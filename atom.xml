    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Demystifying-Quantum-HDR-Technology"><a href="#Demystifying-Quantum-HDR-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Demystifying Quantum HDR Technology"></a>Demystifying Quantum HDR Technology</h2><p>‘Hello,</p><p>What is Quantum HDR, and how does it affect TV screen quality? Please explain to me”.</p><p>One of the fascinating aspects of technology is the never-ending innovation. However, TV terminologies can be quite confusing, that even new technologies in the industry become hard to understand.</p><p>Quantum HDR is one of the latest technologies in the TV industry that many folks still find too hard to understand.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve heard about Quantum HDR once or twice, but you still didn’t know what the technology is all about, worry less because you’ve come to the right page to find out the unknown.</p><p>Here, we’ve covered all you need to know about Quantum HDR. So it’s advisable that you read this article till the end.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Quantum HDR"></a>Part 1: What is Quantum HDR</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/quantum-hdr-everything-you-may-want-to-know-about-quantum-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="quantum hdr"                ></p><p>Just as the name suggests, Quantum HDR is a combination of two amazing technologies namely, ‘Quantum Dots and HDR (High dynamic range).</p><p>“Quantum HDR refers to TVs with a QLED screen that’s compatible with the HDR technology.”</p><p>As we all know, HDR is used to capture more details and colors in images. So, when used in TVs, it usually affects the color accuracy and contrast ratio in images. Therefore, causing an increase in color accuracy and contrast ratio.</p><p>With the presence of HDR in TVs, bright colors become brighter, and details of pictures become more visible. Yes, it does this by increasing the maximum value for three base colors ‘Red, Green, and Blue’ - this causes colors that originated from the mix of the base colors to be brighter and more saturated.</p><p>Quantum, on the other hand, means a TV uses Quantum Dot technology - a new technology used in TV screens by industry brands like Samsung to capture more details and colors in images.</p><p>Screens made of Quantum Dot technology are also referred to as QLED. Yes, this is because such screens tend to display LED lights that use a unique black light different from other TV screens. So, as a result, TVs with such screens usually have higher brightness and contrast while preserving details of the picture.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?"></a>Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?</h2><p>Quantum HDD 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x are known as peak brightness multipliers of a TV screen. Although there’s clear information about these peak brightness multipliers at this point, we could tell it’s another marketing strategy relating to how many metadata streams a TV’s processor would process to make the image displayed on its screen more detailed. For example, since the base brightness of a TV is 100 units, a Quantum HDR with a 16x peak brightness multiplier would have a peak brightness of 1,600 units, Quantum HDR with a 24x peak brightness multiplier would be 2,400 units, and so on.</p><p>In all, we could say the overall brightness of a Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x increases as the peak brightness multiplier increases.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR"><a href="#Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?"></a>Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?</h2><p>Even though Quantum HDR is a new technology, a lot of people still mistake it to be the same as HDR. So, to help clear the air on the difference between these two techniques, we’ve explained their features in the comparison table below;</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Quantum HDR</strong></th><th><strong>HDR</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td>Quantum HDR are TVs with QLED screen that’s compatible with HDR technology</td><td>HDR is an advanced technology that improves the quality and display signals of HDR TV (High dynamic range television)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Technology</strong></td><td>-</td><td>High dynamic range televisions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brightness</strong></td><td>Much Brighter</td><td>Much brighter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best for</strong></td><td>Televisions</td><td>camera</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cost</strong></td><td>$1000+</td><td>$20,000+</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-and-Display-Your-HDR-Video-on-Quantum-HDR-TV"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-and-Display-Your-HDR-Video-on-Quantum-HDR-TV" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make and Display Your HDR Video on Quantum HDR TV?"></a>Part 4: How to Make and Display Your HDR Video on Quantum HDR TV?</h2><p>Truth be told, your TV won’t be able to use HDR unless you’re watching HDR-ready media - It needs a source.

This effect results due to vibration influence that is channelled on camera when it starts rocking in air. No matter whether you are a professional or beginner, Jello effect is always your biggest enemy as it does terrible things inside recorded videos that can distract viewers away from actual content. The article below will help you to gain important information about how to remove this Jello or rolling shutter effect from videos.</p><h2 id="What-is-Rolling-Shutter"><a href="#What-is-Rolling-Shutter" class="headerlink" title="What is Rolling Shutter"></a>What is Rolling Shutter</h2><p>First of all we need to discus about the major terms like rolling shutter effect etc. You might be aware of the fact that sensors can be designed with rolling shutter as well as with a global shutter. This rolling shutter is able to capture footage with better scanning on every part of image due to installed CMOS sensor. Generally, the global shutters are capable enough to manage entire frame at the same time but rolling shutters start scanning from top to bottom and hence they leave various visual artefacts in between. In simple words, it is not able to capture top and bottom portion of shot at same moment hence images appear skewed.</p><h2 id="What-is-Jello-Effect"><a href="#What-is-Jello-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What is Jello Effect"></a>What is Jello Effect</h2><p>As DSLRs usually come with rolling shutters as these shutters are able to follow quick movements that cannot be noticed by users. But the biggest trouble is observed when camera is used to perform quick pans or it has to work with extremely moving subjects same as airplane propellers. These quick pans cause jello effect in clips and images naturally become skewed with loss of details.</p><p>Now, you might be thinking hard that when global shutters are able to serve with better quality for this case then why manufacturers are using rolling shutters. There are numbers of reasons behind this: Systme actually follows a trade-off between performance of global shutters and rolling shutters. You will be glad to know that although a rolling shutter creates trouble with distortion and skew but it has ability to provide best results with dynamic range and low light performance.</p><p>Further, global shutters are not able to achieve the DR value same as rolling shutters hence they cannot be applied for handheld recording needs, visual effects or for action scenes.</p><h2 id="How-to-Remove-Jello-Effect-from-Drone-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Jello-Effect-from-Drone-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Jello Effect from Drone Videos?"></a>How to Remove Jello Effect from Drone Videos?</h2><h4 id="1-Use-Gimbal"><a href="#1-Use-Gimbal" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Gimbal"></a>1. Use Gimbal</h4><p>If you want to minimize those micro jitters from your recorded footage then it becomes necessary to use gimbals or stabilizers with your camera unit. You need to upgrade the gimbal vibration dampers for your device so that it can stay stable all the time. It is good to upgrade gimbal uav damper quality as it can completely remove the jello effect from videos.</p><h4 id="2-Slow-Down"><a href="#2-Slow-Down" class="headerlink" title="2. Slow Down"></a>2. Slow Down</h4><p>One more trick to manage your videos in air is to slow down your shoots. When you organise slow shutter speeds for your drone camera then it is observed that motion blur can easily mask rolling shutter issues. The rolling shutter effect commonly occurs when drone is moving on high speed and camera is having too many vibrations. It is good to work with 60 fps frame rate to avail best results.</p><h4 id="3-Balanced-Propellers"><a href="#3-Balanced-Propellers" class="headerlink" title="3. Balanced Propellers"></a>3. Balanced Propellers</h4><p>If you prefer to use a high quality prop balancer then shots can be easily stabilized. Note that, all props are not pre-calibrated from factory end, once you receive them, it is good to add some efforts for their stabilization and calibration so that flying experience can be enhanced. Installing bad props means you are going to face too much disturbance in footage.</p><h4 id="4-ND-Filters"><a href="#4-ND-Filters" class="headerlink" title="4. ND Filters"></a>4. ND Filters</h4><p>In case if you are observing very small amount of jello effect in your videos but want to get rid of it then ND filters can help you better. These filters are capable enough to preserve colours and they also modify light intensity to avail better results. Users are advised to add lens filters to their camera as it is ensure perfect clarity with better color distribution during aerial video recording.</p><h4 id="5-Post-Production-Solution"><a href="#5-Post-Production-Solution" class="headerlink" title="5. Post Production Solution"></a>5. Post Production Solution</h4><p>Although, it is always recommended to solve the troubles related to rolling effects at source end, so that, output footage appears stable.

They’re also easy to mount on almost any surface i-e., mounting onto your bike helmet makes it easy to capture every moment on your ride, so that it doesn’t matter where you are, you’ll be able to capture what’s happening around you.</p><p>GoPro time-lapse is a way to view the world from your camera’s point of view. It allows you to see everything that happened in a short period, either as it happens or over several days. You can use GoPro time-lapse to make videos about your daily life, or even about events like weddings, and vacations. You can use GoPro time-lapse for a more serious purpose.</p><p>There are many different cameras available on the market today that will work with GoPro time-lapse. Time-lapse videos are filmed at a constant speed and then edited together to create a video that shows the passage of time in real-time. In this blog post, we’ll explore why GoPro time-lapse is important, and how it can help you capture your memories.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode"></a>Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode</h2><p>GoPro time-lapse video mode allows you to create a video that shows the passage of time over a period of days or weeks. The video is created by taking photos at regular intervals and then editing them together so that they appear to run in real-time. One of the most popular uses of GoPro time-lapse videos is when you want to capture something in motion.</p><p>You can use this technique for many different types of subjects including landscapes, cars, people, and animals and you can even add sounds like birds chirping or waves crashing along with them! It’s also possible to make this type of video if you’re using any other camera brand than GoPro itself. This method produces high-quality videos that can be used as promotional material.</p><p>The GoPro time-lapse creates the final video by stitching together the individual still images into one long clip. The software also allows you to manipulate each frame individually, which can be used to adjust the focus and exposure settings of your shot. GoPro Time-lapse videos are videos that show a sequence of events over a substantial period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/gopro-timelapse-video-mode.jpg"                      alt="gopro timelapse video mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro"></a>Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro</h2><p>If you’re a videographer or photographer, you’ve probably considered shooting time-lapse videos. They’re great for showing the passage of time, but they can also be used to show the beauty of a place. With GoPro cameras, you can create a time-lapse video in just minutes. Here’s how to shoot your time-lapse video with GoPro.</p><h5 id="Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode"><a href="#Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Choose your shooting mode"></a>Step1 Choose your shooting mode</h5><p>Firstly, choose the shooting mode, that is which kind of mode you want. If you want to shoot a time-lapse video then first click on the mode button and select the video mode. The video mode will be shown on the front screen after pressing it.</p><h5 id="Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode"><a href="#Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select the time-lapse mode"></a>Step2 Select the time-lapse mode</h5><p>Press the set-up button and go to the video settings which are held on the left side. After that click on the time-lapse video. There are many features and options in HERO8. There is a night lapse option in GoPro which is normally used in night photography. We can use this feature when there is limited lighting. The time-lapse mode was used in earlier models.</p><h5 id="Step3-Change-the-interval-settings"><a href="#Step3-Change-the-interval-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change the interval settings"></a>Step3 Change the interval settings</h5><p>Choosing the correct interval settings is essential to creating a professional-looking time-lapse video. The interval time is the amount of time between each frame in your video. 30 FPS is used by GoPro time-lapse which means 30 pictures are required for a one-second video. The first step to shooting a GoPro time-lapse video is choosing the interval settings.</p><p>This can be done through GoPro’s settings menu, which can be accessed by tapping the icon in the upper right corner of the main screen, then tapping “Settings” in the menu that appears. the camera will take pictures every few seconds while recording video, which is great if you’re trying to hit a certain number of frames per second (FPS).</p><h5 id="Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button"><a href="#Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button"></a>Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button</h5><p>If you want to shoot time-lapse videos on a GoPro, first you’ll need to mount your camera. Then press the shutter button on your camera and start shooting. Attach the camera to the tripod with the adhesive mount provided. Set up your camera by adjusting the settings for exposure, ISO, and other options in the Settings menu (you can find these settings in the Settings tab)</p><p>You’ll probably want to use a wide-angle lens for this kind of video because you’ll want to capture as much of your surroundings as possible. If you want to change the length of time you want to shoot, press the button again until it says “Time Lapse” or whatever setting you want.</p><h5 id="Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting"><a href="#Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting"></a>Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting</h5><p>When you are done with your shooting press the shutter button to end the shooting. GoPro will automatically combine all your clicked photos in a single video. You don’t need to do anything to combine the photos. The best part about this camera is that you can use it to shoot both vertical and horizontal time-lapses, as well as time-lapse photos.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer</h2><p>Editing time-lapse videos can be a bit tricky, but with the right tools and a little bit of practice, you can create some stunning time-lapse videos that will amaze your friends and family.

And there are users feedback to forums that problem appears when enabling deghosting when batch processing in Aurora HDR. So, we are here to recommend some alternatives that you can use.</p><h3 id="1-Luminance-HDR"><a href="#1-Luminance-HDR" class="headerlink" title="1. Luminance HDR"></a>1.

Apart from that, it can also save, load, rotate, and resize HDR photos. You can also apply transformations to your HDR images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/aurora-hdr-review-is-aurora-hdr-a-good-choice-in-2022-3.jpg"                      alt="luminance hdr"                ></p><p>More importantly, Luminance HDR is available for free download on both Windows and Mac devices.</p><p><strong>Best For:</strong></p><p>You can use Luminance HDR for different purposes. However, its best feature is its ability to tone map HDR images to LDR. It offers almost nine other tone mapping operators to represent your HDRi as an LDR image.</p><p>The nine Tone Mapping Operators are Mantiuk ’06, Mantiuk ’08, Fattal, Drago, Durand, Reinhard ’02, Reinhard ’05, Ashikhmin, and Pattanaik.</p><p>Each of the operators provides different parameters according to which your image is adjusted.</p><p><strong>Ratings:</strong></p><p>According to SoureForge.net, Luminance HDR was rated by 55 users and has a rating of 4.6 out of 5.</p><h3 id="2-Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="2.

Some of the main features that Adobe offers are automated editing tools such as auto reframing, quick mode, step-by-step guided edits, sharing with ease, different libraries, and much more.

As of 2020, Adobe allows its users to import, edit and export HLG content. HLG format bundles the SDR and HDR color spaces into one stream of information. Now, users can edit HDR footage without any difficulty.</p><p>One more advantage of Adobe Premiere is that it supports both operating systems, i.e., Mac as well as Windows.</p><p><strong>Best For:</strong></p><p>Adobe Premiere is the most common software used for video editing.

The chart below explains the stat report better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><p>As you can see from the chart above, the best day to publish a podcast is on weekdays. But check the following chart to see the median number of total downloads for every podcast episode posted per hour during the weekdays.</p><p>The chart on the left is the number of episodes published per hour from Monday to Friday, while the chart on the left displays the median total downloads of episodes the podcast episodes get over time.</p><p>Overall, it shows that podcast episodes published in the early hours of a new day tend to do better until 5 AM when their performance starts to drop. However, episodes published just before noon does best in the afternoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-2.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><h3 id="Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast"><a href="#Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast"></a>Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast</h3><p>Here is our take on the podcast publish statistics analyzed by Megaphone in the charts above.</p><p><strong>1. Weekdays are much more popular than weekends</strong></p><p>From the podcast publish days’ statistics in the chart above, it’s obvious most podcasters publish on weekdays compared to weekends. Yes, over 40,000 podcast episodes are published during weekdays while on weekends, it’s within 4,000 to 5,000 episodes. The publishing time usually falls between 2 AM to 5 AM.</p><p>However, in our opinion, we don’t recommend publishing a new podcast at midnight, instead do it by 5 AM. This is will prevent the risk of your podcast getting buried under other podcasters’ shows on the app you are using, and enhance the chances of your podcast being on the first page, thus making it easily seen by your audience.</p><p><strong>2. When is the most popular publishing day?</strong></p><p>Based on the chart above, Wednesday is when the most podcast episodes are published. Over 9000 podcast episodes are published on this day, and the hour with the highest number of publishing is 2 AM.</p><p>But does this mean you should publish your podcast at exactly 2 AM on Wednesday? No! Instead, consider when your audience is most likely to listen. Will they prefer to tune in on their way to work, during work, on their way home, while doing house chores at home, or at night? You need to have a breakdown of this data, so you can choose the best time to publish your podcast.</p><p><strong>3. When is the worst?</strong></p><p>The worst day to publish a podcast is on Sunday, and as mentioned earlier, if you’re publishing during weekdays, do not publish at midnight. But note that the niche of your podcast matters. If Saturday and Sunday are when your audience tends to listen to your podcasts, then don’t hesitate to publish new episodes on weekends.</p><p>The hour with the most downloads per average episode is 5 AM Tuesday, followed by 5 AM Friday and 5 AM Thursday. Still, as mentioned earlier the time when your audience is most like to listen to the podcast matters.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do"><a href="#Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do"></a>Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do</h2><p>The charts above were published by Megaphone based on the podcast episodes published on their platform. However, if you intend to choose the days to publish a podcast based on that, then it’s sad to say you’re about to make a big mistake.</p><p>The truth is it takes time and consistency to find the best days to publish podcasts. Even successful podcasters you see today never had the best days have the best days to publish content when they started. So, before you rush to start posting your podcast based on the chart or how other podcasters upload content, here are things you should know;</p><h3 id="1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms"><a href="#1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms"></a>1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms</h3><p>If you conduct an analysis of how podcast platforms work, you’ll discover all podcast platforms don’t have the same algorithm. For example, the way the Apple Podcast app works can be the same as that of Spotify, Player FM, Stitcher, and many others.</p><p>During our review of different podcast apps, we discovered Apple Podcast app algorithm tends to favor newer episodes, except if you have a show you haven’t listened to in a while. There are also podcast apps with a similar algorithm, but the best time and day to publish podcasts varies.</p><h3 id="2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You"><a href="#2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You" class="headerlink" title="2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You"></a>2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You</h3><p>Just as the saying goes, “One man’s food could be another man’s poison”. Many regular podcasters usually upload content today because other podcasters have done the same. But unfortunately, it’s not a good move to just do things because others are doing it in the podcasting space. So, it’s advisable not to post at the same time others do.</p><h3 id="Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show"><a href="#Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show" class="headerlink" title="Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show"></a>Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show</h3><p>We absolutely can’t help you choose the best day to release a podcast. However, the following tips could help you decide what day and time will suit your podcast show.</p><p><strong>a. Avoid times when your audience will hardly listen to your podcast</strong></p><p>Most people look for podcasts when they are looking for information conversationally. So, you must do findings on knowing when your audience will want to listen to your podcast, though research shows that more people listen to podcasts on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday between 2 AM and 5 AM. But 5 AM is the best time to gather more downloads.</p><p><strong>b. Try to tie it to something more predictable</strong></p><p>Sometimes, you just need to think out of the box when choosing the best day for your podcast. For example, we know weekdays are for going to work, and more people tend to download podcasts by 5 AM on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. So, if your podcast is about “Things you should do at work to make your day less stressful”, there’s a high chance of getting more downloads, as it’ll attract many workers facing a similar problem daily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Regularly-Produce-Podcasts-for-Posting"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Regularly-Produce-Podcasts-for-Posting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Regularly Produce Podcasts for Posting?"></a>Part 4: How To Regularly Produce Podcasts for Posting?</h2><p>After making up your mind on the best day to release a podcast, your next move should be to start producing podcasts for posting.

What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta"><a href="#1-Meta" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft"><a href="#2-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="2.

What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta-3"><a href="#1-Meta-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft-3"><a href="#2-Microsoft-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Microsoft"></a>2. Microsoft</h3><p>It is another tech giant that has advanced considerably in this direction when it revealed its very own hologram technology back in 2019. Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><h3 id="3-Epic-Games-3"><a href="#3-Epic-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Epic Games"></a>3. Epic Games</h3><p>Epic Games is a video game company that has made headlines by virtue of its extraordinary contributions in this regard. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse”, said Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials. Epic Games is reportedly emphasizing its MetaHuman Creator, a technology that helps users customize better their digital avatars.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know-3"><a href="#Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know"></a>Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</h2><p>It is entering the metaverse that necessitates that one first has one’s props ready.

Intel grabbed worldwide attention a few days ago when it said that for metaverse to work properly, one will need devices with 1000x more computing power than what the technology offers today. But since metaverse is still in its embryo, the configuration we have already functioned just fine.</p><h3 id="2-Smartphone-3"><a href="#2-Smartphone-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Smartphone"></a>2. Smartphone</h3><p>Smartphones are the next important metaverse device with chipmakers like Qualcomm, Samsung already sharing their dedication to the mobile metaverse segment. Smartphones with the hardware they already come with are useful though for enjoying some of the games and platforms that use augmented reality.</p><h3 id="3-5G-Mobile-Networks-3"><a href="#3-5G-Mobile-Networks-3" class="headerlink" title="3.5G Mobile Networks"></a>3.5G Mobile Networks</h3><p>For metaverse to really get under one’s skin, one needs a powerful and lightning-fast network that 5G technology promises.

Higher resolution often demands much battery usage.</p><p><strong>Hands Free Pictures:</strong> Pick the best shots even when your hands are occupied in other activities.</p><p><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> Most essential to share recording videos with friends on social media.</p><h2 id="Top-Five-Best-Action-Cameras-for-Fishing"><a href="#Top-Five-Best-Action-Cameras-for-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="Top Five Best Action Cameras for Fishing"></a>Top Five Best Action Cameras for Fishing</h2><h4 id="Comparison-Table"><a href="#Comparison-Table" class="headerlink" title="Comparison Table"></a>Comparison Table</h4><p>| |  <strong>GoPro Hero Session</strong> | <strong>GoPro Hero5 Session</strong> | <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black</strong> | <strong>Garmin VIRB Ultra 30</strong> | <strong>GitUp Git2</strong>        |                   |<br>| ————————- | ———————– | ———————- | ———————— | ——————— | —————– |<br>| <strong>Price</strong>                 | $229.00                 | $299.00                | $399.00                  | $399.99               | $170.99           |<br>| <strong>Weight</strong>                | 74g                     | <strong>73g</strong>                | 117g                     | 87.9g (with battery)  | 64g(with battery) |<br>| <strong>LCD Screen</strong>            | N&#x2F;A                     | N&#x2F;A                    | 2” LCD Touchscreen       | 1.75” LCD Touchscreen | 1.5”LCD screen    |<br>| <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>                 | Yes                     | Yes                    | Yes                      | Yes                   | Yes               |<br>| <strong>Voice Control</strong>         | &#x2F;                       | Yes                    | Yes                      | &#x2F;                     | &#x2F;                 |<br>| <strong>Waterproof</strong>            | 10m Without case        | 10m Without case       | 10m Without case         | 40m Without case      | 30m Without case  |<br>| <strong>Maximum frame rate</strong>    | 1440p&#x2F;30fps             | 4k&#x2F;30fps               | 4k&#x2F;30fps                 | 4k&#x2F;30fps              | 2160p&#x2F;24fps       |<br>| <strong>Photo Resolution</strong>      | 8MP                     | 10MP                   | 12MP                     | 12MP                  | 16MP             |<br>| <strong>Battery</strong>               | 1000mAh                 | 1000mAh                | 1220mmAh                 | 1250mAh               | 950mAh            |</p><h4 id="1-GoPro-Hero-Session"><a href="#1-GoPro-Hero-Session" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Leading-6-Social-Sites-for-Enterprise-Communication"><a href="#Leading-6-Social-Sites-for-Enterprise-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Leading 6 Social Sites for Enterprise Communication"></a>Leading 6 Social Sites for Enterprise Communication</h2><p>Social media is a great way of promoting your business. With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here’s a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg"                      alt="business social media platforms"                ></p><h2 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It’s the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:</p><p>You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg"                      alt="youtube app"                ></p><p>It’s a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they’re interested in has something to do with your field).</p><p>You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business. Not only can you use Instagram to promote your brand and products, but it also allows you to build customer engagement and build a community around your brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/instagram-app.jpg"                      alt="instagram app"                ></p><p>Instagram also has the advantage of being owned by Facebook, which means that you can easily transfer followers from Instagram onto Facebook.</p><h2 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn is a social media platform that is designed for business networking. It can be used to find customers, connect with industry thought leaders, and build relationships with other businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/linkedin-app.jpg"                      alt="linkedin app"                ></p><p>LinkedIn is also a great place to post content, whether it’s articles, videos, or infographics. This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.</p><p>One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company.

The MacBook Pro is available with a few extras that could make it a better choice for professionals with specific needs, such as higher-quality microphones, longer battery life, and, most important, internal cooling fans.</p><p>However, you may not fully understand the concern unless you go technical and explore their respective specifications.</p><h3 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h3><p>Here’s the detailed specifications comparison table explaining the M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro!</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>M1 MacBook Air</strong></th><th><strong>M1 MacBook Pro (13-inch)</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Price</strong></td><td>Starts at $999</td><td>Starts at $1,299</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB</td><td>256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>8GB or 16GB</td><td>8GB or 16GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Apple M1 with 8-core CPU and 7 or 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine</td><td>Apple M1 with 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display Size</strong></td><td>13.3 inches</td><td>13.3 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display Resolution &amp; Brightness</strong></td><td>2560 x 1600, 400 nits</td><td>2560 x 1600, 500 nits</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Estimated Battery Life</strong></td><td>15 hours wireless web browsing</td><td>17 hours wireless web browsing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ports</strong></td><td>2 Thunderbolt&#x2F;USB 4 ports</td><td>2 Thunderbolt&#x2F;USB 4 ports</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Webcam</strong></td><td>720p with Apple’s image signal processor</td><td>720p with Apple’s image signal processor</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>2.8 lbs</td><td>3 lbs</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Speakers</strong></td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers with high dynamic range</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Keyboard</strong></td><td>Magic Keyboard</td><td>Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Authentication</strong></td><td>Touch ID</td><td>Touch ID</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Designs-and-Features-Similar-But-Different"><a href="#Designs-and-Features-Similar-But-Different" class="headerlink" title="Designs and Features: Similar, But Different"></a>Designs and Features: Similar, But Different</h4><p>Now, let’s first talk about the design and features of the M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.</p><p>In both the MacBooks, you get a similar metal design as the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is the MacBook brand’s hallmark. Its display panels are also ubiquitous. Each is a 13.3-inch IPS screen with the exact native resolution (2,560 by 1,600 pixels) and is compatible with the P3 color gamut.</p><p>Both the laptops are around the Magic Keyboard of Apple, which may be prone to malfunction when dust or debris gets under the keycaps, disabling specific keys. However, this keyboard provides a much more traditional, satisfying typing experience on both models. It has a different Touch Bar, a touch-enabled OLED strip above the keyboard, only present on the MacBook Pro.</p><p>A scissor mechanism with a rubber-dome spring back delivers more feedback and feels more stable while typing.</p><p>Both laptops only have USB Type-C ports and a headphone jack. This is common for super-slim laptops, as there isn’t room for more extensive, standard USB Type-A ports.</p><p>Mentioning these similarities are specific key differences intended to put the MacBook Pro a “pro” and make the price worth it.</p><p>Though they are of the same size and resolution, the screen of the MacBook Pro is 20% brighter than the display of the MacBook Air. This could make a significant difference if you frequently work in brightly lit offices.</p><h3 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h3><p>Now, it’s time to discuss the performance of the M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.</p><p>The M1 MacBook Air and the M1 MacBook Pro run on Apple’s M1 system-on-a-chip which features a 16-core Neural Engine and an eight-core central processing unit.</p><p>The base model has a seven-core graphics processing unit with the MacBook Air, while the MacBook Pro consists of an eight-core GPU in its entry-level configuration. That must offer the base MacBook Pro a bit more kick while running graphics-heavy programs and games.</p><p>Another essential difference of features found on the MacBook Pro that the MacBook Air doesn’t have is a cooling fan. The fanless design of MacBook Air is a godsend for anyone who’s dealt with whirring, noisy fans that make your laptop feel like a jet engine once it’s under a bit of pressure. But the MacBook Pro’s fan most probably means it’s excellent to sustain high performance for a longer duration since it won’t have to throttle performance to cool off.</p><p>Overall, the M1 MacBook Pro feels more potent than the Air in graphics-oriented workloads but is generally the same for daily tasks.</p><p>In our entire experience, the MacBook Pro can also encode videos a few minutes quicker than the MacBook Air. For example, it encoded a 10-minute 4K video to 1080p using the Handbrake program within five minutes faster than the MacBook Air. That’s why the MacBook Pro is said to be an ideal choice when it comes to gaming.</p><p>Still, the M1 chip offers a lot of boost to the MacBook Air, making it much more performance-oriented than its Intel-powered predecessor. For example, Apple says the M1-equipped MacBook Air has 3.5 times as much computing power, nine times the machine learning capabilities, five times the graphics performance compared with the Intel-powered Air.</p><h4 id="Component-Considerations-Concerning-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro"><a href="#Component-Considerations-Concerning-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Component Considerations Concerning M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro"></a>Component Considerations Concerning M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro</h4><p>Plenty of shoppers are initially concerned with each laptop’s physical features, making those elements a natural beginning milestone for comparison. Still, we must also consider their respective specs as already discussed.</p><p>The MacBook Air is specifically for less demanding users at a lower price point, and portability tops out with less powerful component options. Apple smartly provides a broader range of prices and power with the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p><p>The MacBook Air comes with an M1 processor, 8GB of memory, and a 256GB SSD. The $1,299 13-inch MacBook Pro also begins with an M1 processor, a 256GB SSD, and an 8GB of memory.</p><p>The other significant difference between the beginner-composition Pro and beginner-composition Air is the quantity of graphics cores, which renders 3D imagery and sends it to the laptop screen.</p><p>The MacBook Air contains seven cores, while the M1 versions of the Pro and top-end Air have eight. It’s a slight difference that most users won’t notice while doing word processing or browsing the web, but it might be worth the upgrade for graphics professionals.</p><h4 id="M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-Battery-Life-and-Features"><a href="#M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-Battery-Life-and-Features" class="headerlink" title="M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro: Battery Life and Features"></a>M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro: Battery Life and Features</h4><p>Both machines offer excellent battery life. The users can get more than 12 hours out of the MacBook Air and, the MacBook Pro also offers an impressively long battery life.</p><p>Apple claims that the Pro should last slightly longer, offering around 17 hours of extended battery life than the MacBook Air’s 15 hours.</p><p>Another significant difference that we’d love to count is that the Pro involves the Touch Bar. Apple launched the Touch Bar in 2016 to expand Mac’s user interface by providing practical, touch-friendly shortcuts above the keyboard.</p><p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro and MacBook Air contains a lot of similarities otherwise. These laptops are available with two Thunderbolt&#x2F;USB 4 ports, Apple’s new and enhanced Magic Keyboard, a 720p webcam in Apple’s chipset, storage options that begin with 256 GB and top out at 2 TB, and Touch ID.</p><p>But, when it comes to the microphones and speakers, there are subtle differences to count among. For example, the MacBook Pro’s speakers support a highly dynamic range, unlike the MacBook Air’s, which should enable the Pro to maintain clear audio at both the lowest and loudest levels.</p><p>Apple describes the microphones of MacBook Pro as better studio-quality microphones with a high signal-to-noise ratio, which the Air lacks.</p><p>So, here we’d like to conclude the MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro M1 regarding their technical specifications, including design.</p><h2 id="Part-2-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-Pros-Cons"><a href="#Part-2-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-Pros-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro: Pros &amp; Cons"></a>Part 2. M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro: Pros &amp; Cons</h2><p>Let’s compare MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro M1 based on their pros and cons as listed below!</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Apple M1 MacBook Air</strong></th><th><strong>Apple M1 MacBook Pro (13-inch)</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td>Good value Enhanced performance with the new M1 processor Exceptional battery life Sleek, portable metal design High-quality keyboard, touchpad, and display Multiple color options</td><td>Long battery life Speedy performance from Apple M1 chip Brilliant Retina display Excellent build quality Comfortable keyboard and trackpad Improved webcam</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cons</strong></td><td>Limited port selection to two USB Type-C connections Still no touch-screen option</td><td>Only two USB-C ports Stingy standard 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM No touch screen</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-3-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-for-Programming"><a href="#Part-3-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-for-Programming" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro for Programming"></a>Part 3. M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro for Programming</h2><p>Should you select between a MacBook Pro over the Air for programming, and if so, why? Now, let’s check out the M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro for programming.</p><p>Always keep in mind that the MacBook Air is adequate for most programming tasks; the MacBook Pro is, of course, recommended if you’re looking to program as a professional or want a rapid machine without hassles for years to come.</p><p>However, the MacBook Air also worked perfectly for programming as it met all the requirements and is modern, sleek, and highly humorous to use.</p><p>While a MacBook Air is ideal for programming, the MacBook Pro offers a more powerful performance while assisting the programmers in handling multiple external monitors effectively without stutter or lag.</p><p>The Mac Pro displays an enhanced GPU and overall enhanced performance on the tech spec side compared to the MacBook Air.</p><p>Suppose there is one reason programmers should go for a MacBook Air. In that case, its ability to handle Java, Linux, intuitive design, display versatility, and compile code adequately.</p><p>While the MacBook Air is relevant for all your programming requirements, the MacBook Pro is just an overall more powerful machine, though slightly bulkier compared to the MacBook Air. Programmers may desire a more sleek machine, but you can also go for a somewhat more bulky one which is a powerful model worth considering.</p><h3 id="M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-RAM"><a href="#M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-RAM" class="headerlink" title="M1 MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: RAM"></a>M1 MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: RAM</h3><p>A MacBook Air adequately handles programming in Ruby, working on web development and utilizing javascript, the performance of MacBook pro is still better.</p><p>This is significantly true for both iOS and Android development since these tasks require more powerful tech specs.</p><p>The RAM you will need is based on how you work and what you are operating on. For example, if you are writing gaming-related code, working on projects with graphics, or compiling onsite, the available amount of RAM at any time will matter. But if you consider the cloud largely (e.g., cloud computing, cloud storage, cloud compiling), you can easily fetch more with less and cheaper RAM, i.e., the MacBook Air.</p><h2 id="Part-4-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-in-Video-Editing"><a href="#Part-4-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-in-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro in Video Editing"></a>Part 4. M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro in Video Editing</h2><p>With its robust M1 Pro or M1 Max chip or stunning 16-inch screen, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro launched in October 2021 is the best laptop period, not to mention the best laptop for the heavy processing of video editing. It’s at least twice as quick as the 2020 MacBook Pro and a lot faster than the MacBook Air, of course.</p><p>Both chips can support editing multiple streams of 8K video in real-time without rendering. They feature a ProRes accelerator in the media engine (two in Pro Max’s case), which is great to speed up pro-video workflows.</p><p>The best part is that the MacBook Pro can be configured with up to a whopping 8TB storage, as can the smaller MacBook Pro 14.</p><p>On the other hand, MacBook Air also has a tremendous amount of power under its hood. It can edit 4K video in Final Cut Pro or other video editing tools without breaking a sweat.</p><p>The latest model of MacBook Air supports the P3 color gamut, which means the screen can display accurate colors, a consideration that is incredibly important for video editors.</p><h2 id="Part-5-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-in-Gaming"><a href="#Part-5-M1-MacBook-Air-vs-MacBook-Pro-in-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro in Gaming"></a>Part 5. M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro in Gaming</h2><p>After considering all the significant factors, let’s understand the M1 MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro on the gaming side.</p><h3 id="An-Experiment-M1-MacBook-Pro-Is-a-Gaming-Laptop"><a href="#An-Experiment-M1-MacBook-Pro-Is-a-Gaming-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="An Experiment: M1 MacBook Pro Is a Gaming Laptop"></a>An Experiment: M1 MacBook Pro Is a Gaming Laptop</h3><p>It is possible to run the GTA 5 and Battlefield 3 on the M1 MacBook Pro.</p><p>After testing the M1 MacBook Pro for gaming, we have encountered no problems so far. The system suggests 4x Anisotropic Filtering in the menu and SSAO - Screen Space Ambient Occlusion and 1,920x1,080 for medium details.</p><p>It’s not the most graphics-oriented ambient occlusion technology. However, Battlefield 3 still looks great on the MacBook’s Retina display: the whipping rain seems along with the Sharp textures, are just as better over this gaming laptop with a high-end card. The gameplay operates well in 45 FPS. However, a MacBook is not an ultra-high-end gaming PC, but, especially in the single-player mode, everything over 40 FPS is well playable.</p><p>On the 13-inch screen, the game performs very well. We have also synced the M1 MacBook Pro to a 27in monitor and a 60 in the TV screen. However, it appears less crispy on a very large 4K display 1080p than on the Retina screen, which is internal.</p><p>At 1.4kg, the current 13in M1 models are light and pleasant. The 8-core CPU is a system-on-a-chip, a merger of GPU, CPU, DDR4 memory, Thunderbolt controller on the one chip, I&#x2F;O chip, and like those found in smartphones.</p><p>We have the same experience with <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</strong>, which performs 1080p with 47 FPS of high settings. This is notable because most 8GB RAM Windows 10 laptops are not suitable for playing this at all -the minimum requirement is 16GB for Windows 10 and 11.</p><h3 id="Gaming-on-the-M1-MacBook-Air"><a href="#Gaming-on-the-M1-MacBook-Air" class="headerlink" title="Gaming on the M1 MacBook Air"></a>Gaming on the M1 MacBook Air</h3><p>Alright, so we finally picked up an M1 MacBook Air (base model 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD) for studying the MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro M1 gaming scenario. First off, it’s crucial to note that many games we’ll be testing were made for the x86 platform and haven’t yet been ported to Apple Silicon, so the performance won’t be at its theoretical best.</p><p>The second big issue is the fanless design of the MacBook Air. Its chip will throttle under load a lot earlier than the MacBook Pro when we do the MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro M1 chip scenario.</p><p>Without any further ado, let’s see how the MacBook Air does.</p><p>The experiment was on League of Legends. And, here are the outcomes: League of legends played perfectly on the M1.</p><p>Set at the default medium preset settings of 1650 x 1050, overall, the game looked excellent, and the FPS was in the 100+ mark, which for a 60Hz display is more than adequate.</p><p>Turning the resolution up to native and the quality to high, the FPS drops to 70 FPS on average (you’ll notice small dips when a lot of animations occur onscreen at the same time, but nothing too wrong).</p><p>After playing two complete games (about an hour and a half in total), there were no stutters, and the temperature stayed at a consistent level. It’s good even when the laptop is fanless.</p><p>Overall this game worked surprisingly well on the MacBook Air.</p><p><strong>CSGO</strong> (Counter-Strike Global Offense) is not an explicitly demanding game by any means, and it’s probably one of the best shooters, along with its Mac compatibility.</p><p>There are problems right after starting the game.</p><p>Considering the outcomes, they seem decent enough, but there were many issues. We could get CSGO to run at 60 FPS in native resolution; however, framerate drops and stutters were standard.</p><p>Moreover, the system’s temperature was pretty warm at 90 - 95 degrees.</p><p>The computer didn’t feel that hot; that said, it was hot to the touch but didn’t feel abnormal at all. Thus, it’s possible that the metrics aren’t entirely reliable.</p><p>Macs aren’t usually ideal for games concerning their small library, and although the Air was not to be your next gaming laptop, it does anyway and with very few complaints.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Overall, the M1 MacBook Air is of significant value, specifically for those looking for a general-purpose laptop. Even though this laptop is $300 cheaper, it doesn’t make immense sacrifices for configuration or performance options except for a few ones that we’ve mentioned above.</p><p>But, there are still some factors: the M1 MacBook Pro may be the ideal fit. Since it has an extra core in its GPU and a fan-based cooling system at the base level, it might be a perfect selection for those who need to execute strenuous tasks for longer durations and still want a lightweight laptop. The Pro also has quality perks and slightly longer battery life, like good-quality speakers and microphones.</p><p>All told, hopefully, you have got our technical and display points on the M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro above. Now, it’s up to which one to go with after analyzing our suggestions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-experts-pathway-navigating-fullscreen-realms-in-premiere-pro/"><u>[New] In 2024, Expert's Pathway  Navigating Fullscreen Realms in Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-novice-to-pro-your-snapseed-journey-starts-here/"><u>2024 Approved  From Novice to Pro  Your Snapseed Journey Starts Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-essentials-of-structuring-your-podcasts-rss-feed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Essentials of Structuring Your Podcast's RSS Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-much-will-it-cost-to-shoot-a-music-video/"><u>2024 Approved  How Much Will It Cost To Shoot A Music Video?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-photo-stability-with-the-right-gimbal/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Photo Stability with the Right Gimbal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/in-2024-speech-to-text-technology-absolutely-gratuitous/"><u>In 2024, Speech-to-Text Technology, Absolutely Gratuitous</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-blending-realms-a-guide-to-photomosaic-creation/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Blending Realms  A Guide to PhotoMosaic Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-tutorial-crafting-photo-videos-in-pixiz/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Tutorial  Crafting Photo Videos in Pixiz</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-turning-challenges-into-paydays-top-8-tiktok-money-making-ways/"><u>2024 Approved  Turning Challenges Into Paydays  Top 8 TikTok Money-Making Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-fast-tracking-visual-storytelling-with-google-collages/"><u>[New] Fast-Tracking Visual Storytelling with Google Collages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-gourmet-gems-7-tips-to-transform-your-kitchen-cinematography/"><u>2024 Approved  Gourmet Gems  7 Tips to Transform Your Kitchen Cinematography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-infinix-note-30-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Solutions to Find Your Infinix Note 30 Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/mastering-video-production-with-powerdirector-24/"><u>Mastering Video Production with PowerDirector '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-10-best-free-image-hosting-sites/"><u>2024 Approved  10 Best Free Image Hosting Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-11-without-passcode-4-easy-methods-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock Apple iPhone 11 Without Passcode? 4 Easy Methods | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-wearable-action-cameras-for-extreme-sport/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Best Wearable Action Cameras For Extreme Sport</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/rectifying-partial-muted-sounds-in-facebook-media-shows/"><u>Rectifying Partial Muted Sounds in Facebook Media Shows</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The taken picture’s resolution is based on the video’s resolution for example; the pictures taken during 4k videos will have more resolution than 1080p. Although they both will lie lower than the standard photo resolution.</li></ul><p> Nevertheless, the resolution loss will increase when taking still from slow motion recording. On one hand where people find standard resolution beyond satisfaction, losing some amount of digits from the resolution won’t make difference too for many at the same time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>iPhone Model</th><th>Standard Photo Resolution</th><th>Phone Resolution While Recording Video-1080p</th><th>Photo Resolution While Recording Video-4K</th><th>Photo Resolution While Recording Video-Slo Mo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>iPhone 5 &amp; 5S</strong></td><td>3264 × 2448</td><td>1280 × 720</td><td>n&#x2F;a</td><td>n&#x2F;a</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 6 series</strong></td><td>3264 × 2448</td><td>2720 × 1532</td><td>n&#x2F;a</td><td>n&#x2F;a</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone SE</strong></td><td>4032 × 3024</td><td>3412 × 1920</td><td>3840 × 2160</td><td>1280 × 720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 6S series</strong></td><td>4032 × 3024</td><td>3412 × 1920</td><td>3840 × 2160</td><td>1280 × 720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 7 series</strong></td><td>4032 × 3024</td><td>3412 × 1920</td><td>3840 × 2160</td><td>1280 × 720</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Extract-frames-from-video"><a href="#Extract-frames-from-video" class="headerlink" title="Extract frames from video"></a>Extract frames from video</h2><p> If you are one of those who wish to <strong>take photos while recording videos</strong> without compromising the quality, we are glad to inform you that there is a solution for this.

In addition, gaming monitors are a completely new concept for many console owners. It was easy to choose a 4K TV with Xbox One, but we experienced some interesting alternatives when the next generation came along.</p><p>As console owners gravitate toward monitors in order to take advantage of the incredible framerates and resolutions the Xbox Series X can deliver, the pull of monitors appears to be increasing. Let’s check out some of our top picks for the best monitors for Xbox Series X, and keep in mind that HDMI 2.1 monitors are on the way, so if you’re interested in seeing what’s coming, please head over to our top picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                      alt="xbox-seriesx"                ></p><h4 id="Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="Using a monitor with Xbox Series X"></a><strong>Using a monitor with Xbox Series X</strong></h4><p>The best way to enjoy Xbox Series X is to get a monitor that supports either 8K at 60hz or 4K at 120hz, which means that you’ll need an HDMI 2.1 monitor. In spite of the fact that there are some amazing HDMI 2.1 cable options out there, HDMI 2.1 monitors are not as common as they could be at this moment, but we expect them to appear soon.</p><p>Accordingly, the most common monitor options available for Xbox Series X gamers as of right now are 1080p at 120Hz, 1440p at 120Hz, or 4K at 60Hz. Even though 120hz gaming doesn’t require an HDMI 2.1 monitor, one popular approach involves lowering the resolution while increasing framerates. The ability to play either racing or FPS games at 1080p at 120Hz would be an example of this.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Monitors For Your ps5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best TVs You Can Find in 2024 for ps5 and Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Our Top Picks For Best Xbox Series X Monitors</strong></p><h4 id="1-Samsung-Odyssey-G7-32-Inch"><a href="#1-Samsung-Odyssey-G7-32-Inch" class="headerlink" title="1.

It features a contrast ratio of 3000:1 and HDR, giving gamers a more immersive and realistic gaming experience. There is no question that this is not a ‘budget’ monitor, but its design is pretty epic (with LEDs too), and it could work well with a number of different types of games, including fast-paced FPSes as well as upcoming slower and dramatic releases.</p><h4 id="3-ASUS-VP28UQG-28-Inch-4K"><a href="#3-ASUS-VP28UQG-28-Inch-4K" class="headerlink" title="3.

The monitor has outstanding motion handling and an excellent 1080p resolution. The stand allows you to adjust the ergonomics and it’s decently well-built. There are wide viewing angles on the IPS panel, which makes it easy to see even in bright settings. As a result of its low contrast ratio, it is not suitable for dark rooms.</p><p>There are no blur trails behind fast-moving objects because the display is exceptionally responsive, whether you play at 120Hz or 60Hz.

It also has an IPS panel but is an inch smaller than the Acer Nitro XV282K. However, it still offers good response times and VRR support despite its lack of HDMI 2.1 ports and 60Hz refresh rate. Due to its lack of USB ports, and lack of gaming features, the laptop doesn’t have many gaming capabilities. However, you do get built-in speakers, and you can also use Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture to display two input sources simultaneously, ideal for gaming while watching a movie or a show.</p><p>Go with the Acer if you can afford it.
