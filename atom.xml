    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Implementing-Soft-Cessation-of-Sounds-Using-Audacity-Procedures"><a href="#Implementing-Soft-Cessation-of-Sounds-Using-Audacity-Procedures" class="headerlink" title="Implementing Soft Cessation of Sounds Using Audacity Procedures"></a>Implementing Soft Cessation of Sounds Using Audacity Procedures</h2><p>Free, open-source freeware for Windows and Mac, Audacity, is a powerful toolkit to Fade Audacity. You could wish to employ the common music production method of fading songs in and out of your podcast using Audacity fade. To make an engaging and deeper podcast, it’s helpful to understand how to slightly fade out the music so that it plays in the background but still makes it easy to hear the spoken track. There are a few ways to do this.</p><p>You can easily apply professional fades to your audio files with Audacity fade out effect. The audio in the chosen portion will progressively get quieter when the fade out effect is applied, ending in stillness. The fade out tool is nearly totally automated, making it simple and understandable for both novices and experts. Along with the other several tools under Audacity’s Effects menu, the fade out tool may be found there.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Linear-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Part-1-Linear-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Linear Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Part 1. Linear Fade in&#x2F;out</h2><p>You may apply linear fades, a straightforward fade option, to any segment of your music. Alternatively, you might apply it to the full audio file. Linear fades come in two varieties. Fade-in and Fade-out are the two varieties. Any section of your audio that you apply a fade-in to will get muted and return to its original volume. Additionally, if you activate the fade-out feature in your audio, the audio will transition from its original volume to total quiet.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Linear-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Linear-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Linear Fade in&#x2F;out:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Linear Fade in&#x2F;out:</strong></h3><p>To divide a track into several parts so you may apply a fade to a specific audio segment, press Cmd + I (or Ctrl + I).</p><p>In this example, we divided the clip at the eight-second mark and used the Time Shift tool to shift the second chunk to the new location.</p><p>By selecting the audio segment, you wish to fade out and selecting Effect &gt; Fade Out, you may add a fade-out to the initial clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/liner-fade-in-audacity.jpg"                      alt="liner fade in audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Studio-Fade-Out"><a href="#Part-2-Studio-Fade-Out" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Studio Fade Out"></a>Part 2. Studio Fade Out</h2><p>This effect is shown by Audacity as a curve that resembles the letter S. It results in a very gentle fading. After the first boom, there is utter quiet. It’s a sound that actually gives off the impression of fading away over time. Using the repeat last effect, you can quickly repeat this fading option. Additionally, Ctrl + R serves as the shortcut for the same.</p><h3 id="How-to-Use-Studio-Fade-Out"><a href="#How-to-Use-Studio-Fade-Out" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Studio Fade Out:"></a><strong>How to Use Studio Fade Out:</strong></h3><p>Choose your audio segment, go to the Effect menu, slide to the bottom, and pick Studio Fade Out to apply the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/studio-fade-out-audacity.jpg"                      alt="studio fade out audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Adjustable-Fade"><a href="#Part-3-Adjustable-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Adjustable Fade"></a>Part 3. Adjustable Fade</h2><p>A dialog box will show up on the screen when you choose the customizable fade option. You may customize the form and pattern of the fading using that dialog box. You may use this ability to make partial fades if you’d like. You must maintain the tracks stacked one on top of the other with the lower track underneath the higher track and its end overlapping when employing this form of fade.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Adjustable-Fade"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Adjustable-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:</strong></h3><ul><li>Select Effect from the menu.</li><li>Select the variable fading option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjustable-fade-audio-audacity.jpg"                      alt="adjustable fade audio audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Crossfades-Audacity"><a href="#Part-4-Crossfades-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Crossfades Audacity"></a>Part 4. Crossfades Audacity</h2><p>There are two choices available when using this effect. You have two options: either manually make a crossfade of your own, or utilize one of the pre-existing crossfades in Audacity. In Audacity, there are two crossfades that are accessible. Crossfade clips and Crossfade tracks are what they are. Crossfade clips make it easier to switch between two distinct clips. Additionally, crossfade tracks aid in crossfading between two audio tracks and are more exact.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Crossfades"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Crossfades" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Crossfades:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Crossfades:</strong></h3><p>Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track.</p><p>Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect &gt; Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossafade-audio-with-audacity.jpg"                      alt="crossafade audio with audacity"                ></p><p>Use your Selection tool to organize the clips such that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect &gt; Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-5-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Alternative Way to Fade Audio"></a>Part 5.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how it works:</p><ol><li>Open the Filmora Video Editor and click Create New Project to kickstart editing.</li><li>Select the Import tab to browse the video you want to edit.

Video Color Adjustment"></a><strong>4. Video Color Adjustment</strong></h3><p>You can adjust the color of your video using advanced color correction presets available in Filmora. The platform features a number of pre-made templates for this purpose, including vignettes, film looks, and 3D LUT effects. Similarly, you can even save any custom color settings to apply to your videos according to the project’s requirements.</p><p>The process to use it is quite simple, as you need to double-click the color preset you want to use. Next, it will be applied automatically, and you can check what the video looks like.</p><p>Here are some other color adjustment parts you can use:</p><ul><li><strong>Exposure:</strong> Adjusting this can make your video brighter or darker. A negative value darkens the colors, while a positive value lightens them. It’s great for fixing images that are too bright or too dark.</li><li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Simply controls the overall brightness of your video.</li><li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This slider lets you fine-tune the contrast between light and dark areas in your video. Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.</li><li><strong>Vibrance:</strong> Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.</li></ul><p>In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.</p><p><strong>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):</strong> HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.</p><ul><li><strong>Hue:</strong> You can fine-tune the color’s shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.</li><li><strong>Luminance:</strong> Control the brightness of the color range you’ve selected.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The GoPro Max 360 and GoPro Hero 11 serve different videography needs.

The drop-down menu located underneath the sound level meters on top allows you to rapidly choose between the numerous audio sources.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Crossfade"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Crossfade?"></a>Part 1. What is Crossfade?</h2><p>Crossfading process allows two sounds to segue smoothly into one another. Crossfading is an audio effect that is often used in audio engineering to merge two or more sounds in a song gradually rather than suddenly. This method is mostly used to prevent any abrupt silences between two songs, which might disturb listeners. As a result of the development of the computer-based digital audio editor, crossfading became more straightforward.</p><p>When you cross fade music, you cause one piece of audio to fade out—the sound gradually vanishes—at the precise same moment as another piece of audio fades in—the sound gradually manifests. This effect produces a seamless transition between the two songs without any abrupt pauses or quiet in between. The volume of audio in the source files is the sole restriction on the duration of the fade in a digital editor that supports crossfading between two or more files.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity"></a>Part 2. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity</h2><p>Don’t be intimidated by the capabilities of this audio program. Before the first event completely vanishes into the second, the crossfade gradually transitions by overlaying the events at the transition point so that both are seen or heard at the same time. Using Audacity, it’s easy to reduce some of the background noise in your audio track. You must create a noise profile to do this. We’ve put up a helpful guide on how to use Audacity to enhance your audio productions.</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Audacity Crossfade</strong>:</p><p>Step1 Select File, Import, and Audio from the menu. You may choose one or more audio files, and Audacity will automatically import them into the current project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/import-audio-into-audacity.jpg"                      alt="import audio into audacity"                ></p><p>Step2 Select File, followed by Recent files. The first of the 12 most recent saved or imported files will be imported if you do this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-import-recent-files.jpg"                      alt="select import recent files"                ></p><p>Step3 Use your Selection tool to align the clips so that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect &gt; Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-songs-audacity.jpg"                      alt="crossfade songs audacity"                ></p><p>Step4 Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track. Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect &gt; Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/combine-sound-clips-audacity.jpg"                      alt="combine sound clips audacity"                ></p><p>Step5 This project should be exported as an MP3. Once you’ve finished editing, choose File &gt; Export &gt; Export as MP3 from the menu. From this point on, a pop-up window with a number of fields will appear, allowing you to choose how the file is saved.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

You’ve snapped a fabulous picture of your cat&#x2F;dog&#x2F;child, but on your screen, it’s sideways and impossible to look at. Turning the phone is no use either, as it just keeps spinning the photo to the wrong orientation. If you’re wondering how to rotate photos on iPhone, it’s simple; here’s how.</p><p> Check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Fix Upside Down Videos? &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-rotate-photos-on-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-rotate-photos-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to rotate photos on iPhone"></a>How to rotate photos on iPhone</h2><p> There are a couple of options available which will successfully reorient your image. You don’t even need an additional app, as all the functionality is already built in to your clever little handset. Here’s the method step by step:</p><h4 id="1-Start-your-Photos-app"><a href="#1-Start-your-Photos-app" class="headerlink" title="1. Start your Photos app"></a>1. Start your Photos app</h4><p> The Photos app comes pre-installed on all iPhones and iPads, so no download needed.</p><h4 id="2-Locate-the-squiffy-photo"><a href="#2-Locate-the-squiffy-photo" class="headerlink" title="2. Locate the squiffy photo"></a>2. Locate the squiffy photo</h4><p> Scroll through your images until you find the one that doesn’t look quite right.</p><h4 id="3-Tap-the-‘edit’-button"><a href="#3-Tap-the-‘edit’-button" class="headerlink" title="3. Tap the ‘edit’ button"></a>3. Tap the ‘edit’ button</h4><p> It’s the button at the bottom which looks like three lines with circles on them.</p><h4 id="4-Tap-the-‘crop’-button"><a href="#4-Tap-the-‘crop’-button" class="headerlink" title="4. Tap the ‘crop’ button"></a>4. Tap the ‘crop’ button</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-iphone-photos.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Image resource: imore.com</p><p> This button looks like a rectangle with arrows circling it and is found next to ‘cancel’.</p><h4 id="5-Tap-the-‘rotate’-button"><a href="#5-Tap-the-‘rotate’-button" class="headerlink" title="5. Tap the ‘rotate’ button"></a>5. Tap the ‘rotate’ button</h4><p> This is a white square with one arrow, which you’ll find just above ‘cancel’.</p><h4 id="6-Tap-as-many-times-as-you-need"><a href="#6-Tap-as-many-times-as-you-need" class="headerlink" title="6. Tap as many times as you need"></a>6. Tap as many times as you need</h4><p> One tap will rotate your image 90 degrees. One more will rotate it 180, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-iphone-photos-2.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Image resource: imore.com</p><h4 id="7-And-you’re-done"><a href="#7-And-you’re-done" class="headerlink" title="7. And you’re done"></a>7. And you’re done</h4><p> Once you’re completely happy with the rotation of the picture, tap the yellow ‘done’ button to save your changes.</p><p> It really is as simple as that. Unfortunately, Apple saw fit to hide the rotation function within the button used for cropping pictures, so many users overlook this functionality. But now, you don’t have to, as you know how to rotate photos on iPhone so that every image is perfect!</p><h2 id="Stop-taking-upside-down-photos"><a href="#Stop-taking-upside-down-photos" class="headerlink" title="Stop taking upside down photos"></a>Stop taking upside down photos</h2><p> When iOS 5 brought us the ability to take photos on iPhones with the volume buttons, iPhone users rejoiced. At last, there was an easier way to snap images quickly, and without needing a spare finger to tap the screen. However, with this intervention also came a new problem; upside down photos.</p><p> If you’re in the habit of taking photos using your volume buttons, it feels natural to have these buttons at the top of the phone when shooting in portrait mode. After all, the shutter buttons on our digital cameras are at the top, so it’s natural to want to put the volume buttons there too. But when you shoot like this, all your images will display upside down when you upload them to your social media or laptop, if you’re a Windows user. If you use a Mac, the PC will recognize the image is upside down and will change it, but if you send that picture to a client or friend on Windows, it will, once again, be the wrong way up.</p><p> Here’s an easy way to stop taking upside down photos with your iPhone:</p><h4 id="1-Check-where-the-lens-is"><a href="#1-Check-where-the-lens-is" class="headerlink" title="1. Check where the lens is"></a>1. Check where the lens is</h4><p> Take a glance at the lens position on the back of the phone. Whether you’re taking a portrait or landscape picture, the lens should always be at the top.</p><h4 id="2-Practice-holding-it-the-right-way-up"><a href="#2-Practice-holding-it-the-right-way-up" class="headerlink" title="2. Practice holding it the right way up"></a>2. Practice holding it the right way up</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-iphone-photos-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Image resource: imore.com</p><p> Having the volume buttons at the bottom might feel weird at first, but with a little practice, you’ll get used to it.</p><h4 id="3-Check-you’re-not-covering-the-lens"><a href="#3-Check-you’re-not-covering-the-lens" class="headerlink" title="3. Check you’re not covering the lens"></a>3. Check you’re not covering the lens</h4><p> Because you’re using the volume buttons in their correct position, you might be tempted to splay your fingers across the back of the phone, covering the lens.</p><p> If you’re a habitual upside-down photo-taker, it may take a little while to break this bad habit. At least now, if you do take a photo upside-down, you know how to rotate photos on iPhone using the Photos app. With a bit of practice, however, it will soon feel natural to hold the camera in its proper orientation.</p><p> iPhones are wonderful devices for budding photographers of all shapes and sizes. No other smartphone can come close to the capabilities of Apple’s iPhone in terms of picture quality, functionality and scope. By getting to know some of the hidden tricks and tools to improve your images, you’ll be the envy of every Instagrammer on the planet!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-taking-the-first-steps-towards-vr-technology-mobile-based-headsets-vs-cabled-gear/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Taking the First Steps Towards VR Technology Mobile-Based Headsets Vs.

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="icon note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Click <a class="link"   href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/one-dev-minute/how-to-use-the-azure-cognitive-services-net-speech-sdk-for-recognition" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a detailed guide on how to use Azure Speech Services with Visual Basic (SDK).</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?</h2><p>We should all agree that using Microsoft Azures Speech Service is not a walk in the park.

Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers.

However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos"><a href="#Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora To Make STT videos"></a>Use Filmora To Make STT videos</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-Earnings-via-Sponsored-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Mastering-Earnings-via-Sponsored-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Earnings via Sponsored YouTube Videos"></a>Mastering Earnings via Sponsored YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you are just starting your channel, don’t expect someone to sponsor the channel right away, you need to create ways for the sponsor to come to you because now a days YouTube creators are becoming valuable assets to brands. Subscriber trust creator’s opinions and can learn about new products in just a few minutes. Branded content and sponsored video are a great way to make additional revenue from your YouTube sponsor and grow your YouTube channel. As long as you have an engaged audience, its possible to secure sponsored content opportunities on YouTube.</p><p>Most content creator rely on sponsorship to make money from YouTube these days. The good news is that even if you have small channel this is still an option that’s available to you.</p><p>In this article, we’ll tell you exactly how to get sponsored on YouTube.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Sponsored-video"><a href="#What-is-Sponsored-video" class="headerlink" title="What is Sponsored video"></a>What is Sponsored video</h2><p>Product sponsorship are when a brand sends you a free product to review. Product reviews are often the first sponsorship type a creator experience. Paid sponsorships are the highest level of YouTube sponsorship, you promote product or service on your channel in exchange for payment. They’re more likely to come your way once you’ve started to grow your channel.</p><p>Youtubers collaborate or accept sponsorship with the brand that fit their channel genre and personal interest so the sponsored videos resonate with their subscriber and target audience.</p><h2 id="Ways-to-Have-Sponsored-Product"><a href="#Ways-to-Have-Sponsored-Product" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Have Sponsored Product"></a>Ways to Have Sponsored Product</h2><h3 id="Focus-on-your-content"><a href="#Focus-on-your-content" class="headerlink" title="Focus on your content"></a>Focus on your content</h3><p>Given that you created now your YouTube channel, make sure to make a video that focus on what your niche or content. Think about what companies and products would be the most relevant, enjoyable, and valuable to your viewers. Example you like to talk about skin care products. Make sure that at least your first 10 videos focus about skin care. Or maybe make a video that relatable to everyone, but if you want products sponsorships do some products review on your channel. You will find your target audience if your consistent on the video you are creating. Products sponsors may come your way if you are consistent even if you have small audience or subscribers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/focus-on-video-content.jpg"                      alt="focus on video content"                ></p><h3 id="Invest-in-your-video"><a href="#Invest-in-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Invest in your video"></a>Invest in your video</h3><p>I personally, before the brand noticed my channel, i invested in products that i will review on my channel. I buy to try and do a review because i know someday this brand will noticed or watch my video and in this way i also got a chance to practice my speaking skills in front of the camera. If you are just starting this career, no one will come right away to sponsor you, so you need to make a way to get noticed and this is one way for you to be able to have a product sponsorship.</p><p>Essentially, you should think of your channel as your portfolio that brands will see before deciding to collaborate. The more professional your channel looks, the more opportunities you could have.</p><p>Don’t rush everything or you’re get tired right away. the first thing you have to do is make a hard effort to create quality content so that your channel will stand out from others. Remember there are a lot of content creator doing the same products review. The only thing you will do is make your own style and make sure you’re not copying others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/invest-in-your-video.jpg"                      alt="invest in your video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902273/19272" target="_top" id="1902273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902273/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134235/18498" target="_top" id="2134235">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134235" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134235/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Reach-out-to-Brands"><a href="#Reach-out-to-Brands" class="headerlink" title="Reach out to Brands"></a>Reach out to Brands</h3><p>The best way to get a sponsorship, especially for products reviewing, is by reaching out to the brands.</p><p>You can make an email and send it to the target brand but make sure you created a personalized email. Always do research about the brand and if possible, create a video that you are using or reviewing their products. Some brands are more likely to offer a sponsorship to creator who are using their products.</p><p>Make a sponsorship proposal to offer a business with the brand, include in the letter the benefits of the brand on sponsoring on you channel, give them the positive output and an eagerness that you can help them increase their sales by doing a product review on your channel. But make sure that all Brand you’re reaching out is the brand you tried and tested. Don’t ever collaborate to the brand that you don’t like to.</p><p>You should already have several videos on your channel before you approach brands, and it’s important to demonstrate that you have a consistent posting schedule. Brand want to get their products and services in front of potential buyers, so you’ll need to show that your videos have views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/reach-out-to-brands.jpg"                      alt="reach out to brands"                ></p><h3 id="Contact-Information"><a href="#Contact-Information" class="headerlink" title="Contact Information"></a>Contact Information</h3><p>Don’t forget to always put your contact information in each of your video, you can use the description box to put your contact details like your, email address, Facebook account page, Instagram account where they can direct message you and your other social media. Just put all information where brand can contact you in case, they want to offer you a products collaboration or sponsorships.

So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone.

So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p><p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature.

But the big question is ‘If your audience doesn’t turn on the sound of your videos, how do they get the message you’re trying to pass?” Well, this is why adding ‘Subtitles’ to your videos is crucial. However, for a subtitle to work, it needs to comply with the structure of a video player or any platform you intend to use it on. And fortunately, SRT is a universal format, making it usable on any social media platform.</p><p>In this guide, you’ll be introduced to the simple methods you can utilize to upload SRT files to social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. But before we proceed, let’s take a look at an overview of the different social media platforms and the subtitle file formats they support.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Social Media Platform</th><th>SRT</th><th>VTT</th><th>STL</th><th>SSA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YouTube</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vimeo</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the overview table above, it’s obvious you can easily create one SRT file and easily use it on different social media channels. This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to.
