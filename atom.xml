So, if you are looking for interesting suggestions for a live-stream podcast, luckily, you are at the right place.</p><p>This article explains the power of live-stream podcasts, how to make a live podcast, and the platforms used for it. Talking about its diversity, it can be an interview, monologue, Q&amp;A, customer interview&#x2F;testimonial, educational show, or News. Well, we first have to know the impact podcasts have created worldwide. So let’s jump right into it!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-The-Power-of-Live-Podcast-Streaming"><a href="#Part-1-The-Power-of-Live-Podcast-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Power of Live Podcast Streaming"></a>Part 1. The Power of Live Podcast Streaming</h2><p>Live streaming is worthwhile and something podcasters needs to learn and embrace. Here are some reasons why.</p><h3 id="Get-More-Engagement-With-Audiences"><a href="#Get-More-Engagement-With-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Get More Engagement With Audiences"></a>Get More Engagement With Audiences</h3><p>Over the years, podcasts have shown constant growth in engaging audiences. Many actors and brands use it as a new way to get more engagement among new audiences keeping the base audience intact. In addition, with the increasing use of smartphones, live-stream video podcast listeners have increased miraculously.</p><p>And that’s amazing as well when you look at the stats worldwide. According to the sources, 57% of whites, 16% of Hispanics, 13% of African Americans, and 4% of Asians currently listen to live podcast streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="greater audience engagement"                ></p><h3 id="Express-Thoughts-in-Real-Time"><a href="#Express-Thoughts-in-Real-Time" class="headerlink" title="Express Thoughts in Real-Time"></a>Express Thoughts in Real-Time</h3><p>Another fantastic thing about live-stream video podcasts is the real-time expression of thoughts. You can interact with the virtual live audience and express your feelings, reviews, and ideas on many different topics. So it becomes a two-way conversation. Unlike films, seasons, or dramas, live podcasts show the real side of a person.</p><h3 id="Better-Relationships-With-Audiences"><a href="#Better-Relationships-With-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Better Relationships With Audiences"></a>Better Relationships With Audiences</h3><p>Podcasts are emerging platforms for creating content. It requires a lot of creative work to get that going. However, most listeners are there to listen to live-stream video podcast content and focus more on it. So it creates a better bond. Unlike unending scrolling on social media platforms, a loyalty-based relationship is formed with the audience.</p><h3 id="A-Huge-Source-of-Revenue-for-Your-Podcasts"><a href="#A-Huge-Source-of-Revenue-for-Your-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="A Huge Source of Revenue for Your Podcasts"></a>A Huge Source of Revenue for Your Podcasts</h3><p>Not only is a live-stream podcast a way of gaining access to a global audience, but also a way to generate money. A podcaster can make money through sponsorships, affiliate sales, paid subscriptions, and complementary products.</p><p>According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/podcast-revenue#:~:text=The%20latest%20statistics%20show%20that,%242.2%20billion%20by%20next%20year." >Oberlo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>‘s surveys, the latest statistics show the US is expected to hit $1.73 billion, a 28.6% annual increase in podcasting revenue.

Affiliate sales, advertisements, paid subscriptions, and sponsorships helped podcasters to grow their income.

We will discuss some key factors to make live podcasting successful here. Let us move step-wise.</p><h3 id="1-Timing-Is-Everything"><a href="#1-Timing-Is-Everything" class="headerlink" title="1. Timing Is Everything"></a>1. Timing Is Everything</h3><p><em>“What is the best time to go live?”</em></p><p>There is no proper answer to this question. Several factors, like your target audience, your niche, and your geographic location, will play a part in the timing of going live. So here, we are going to give you some tips about time management.</p><p>Confirm a schedule with your guest (if you have one), ensuring you’re both on the same page about timing, even if you are not in the same time zone. For example, if you want a maximum live audience in the US, then the best time for you to live stream is when most US live stream viewers are active. You have to make sure your guest should make it to go live as well, irrespective of his time zone.</p><p>Secondly, it is also vital when to hold the live podcasting. It would help if you researched what time you will get the most audience. Consider what type of content you create and what lifestyle your audience leads, and decide accordingly.</p><p>Let’s get into this situation; a Sunday morning might be a good option if your podcast is about meditation and well-being, as it’s a classic time for taking things slow and resetting before the coming week.</p><p>Here is a summary of different social media platforms when you get the maximum audiences.</p><ul><li>YouTube - Weekends 12 PM to 2 PM</li><li>Facebook - Tuesdays and Thursdays 1 PM to 4 PM</li><li>Twitch - All days from 1 AM to 9 AM</li></ul><p>We now move on to take the most fundamental step of our work which is making a checklist of things to do.

The theme, the guests, the intro of the video, and various question and answer sessions need a script to carry things smoothly.</p><p>The writing is fundamental even if you are going to hold a monologue live podcast. So you have to brainstorm your topics and decide on the podcast theme. You have to invite the guests, give your podcast a name, and get the right equipment and setup. Everything needs to be scripted to have a podcast preview.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-5.jpg"                      alt="review your podcast with a checklist"                ></p><h3 id="3-Set-Up-Your-Podcasting-Gear-Properly"><a href="#3-Set-Up-Your-Podcasting-Gear-Properly" class="headerlink" title="3. Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly"></a>3. Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly</h3><p>Let’s run through various gadgets used to start live podcast streaming and how to make a live podcast. Let’s dive in!</p><p><strong>Camera</strong></p><p>Good display quality is the most integral part of live podcast streaming. Therefore, a reliable camera is essential for a live podcasting kit. The recommended tool for this purpose is a good-quality webcam. Unfortunately, many people use DSLR and mirrorless cameras, which aren’t suitable for shooting for a long time.</p><p>Here we have some fantastic products for you as an option. When it comes to visual fidelity, 4K resolution isn’t everything. Achieving superb quality is highly dependent on webcam light sensors and pixel size. Here are a few recommendations for you.</p><ol><li>Smartphones</li></ol><p>Everyone has a smartphone, and you don’t need to buy a new gadget, making it a cheaper and easier option. But there are difficulties connecting it to your PC or laptop.</p><ol start="2"><li>Webcams</li></ol><p>Many laptops and PC setups have internal webcams. However, the display gets grainy sometimes. You can also go for external webcams. The external webcams are tiny and portable. Maybe, you can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo-pro" >Razor Kiyo Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with more than two micrometers which is superior to other 4K webcams. If you are a beginner with a low budget, you can always go for alternatives.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-6.jpg"                      alt="razor kiyo pro"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>DSLR</li></ol><p>DSLR (digital single-lens reflex camera) is notable for allowing interchangeable lenses on the same camera body. However, it is just one type of digital camera. Investing in DSLR gives options for the future and provides crystal clear images, for example, <a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/compact-digital-cameras/coolpix-b500.html"><strong>Nikon COOLPIX B500</strong></a>. It captures moments in full HD 1080p quality with stereo sound. It also counteracts shaky hands for tripod-steady videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-7.jpg"                      alt="nikon coolpix b500"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047361/19272" target="_top" id="2047361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>XLR or USB Microphone</strong></p><p>You might have heard some things about XLR and USB microphones. For example, “XLR microphones sound more professional” or “USB microphones are less of a hassle.” Unfortunately, XLR can’t be connected directly to your computer. Instead, you’ll need an audio interface to enter the digital world and want to make recordings using your computer or smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-8.jpg"                      alt="atr 2100x-usb"                ></p><ol><li>Condenser Podcasting Microphones</li></ol><p>Sensitive to high frequency and environmental noise.

It enables texture and depth to the video. Not only is the lighting essential, but also the positioning of light. It starts to create shadows on a person’s face. Lighting drastically changes how someone looks in live streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-10.jpg"                      alt="elgato key light mini-portable led panel"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod Stands</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-11.jpg"                      alt="ubeesize 67 phone tripod &amp; selfie stick, and camera tripod stands"                ></p><p>An innovative, sturdy tripod stand can hold your camera and smartphone to capture steady frame shots.

You got a great story&#x2F;script to film on?</p><p> Well, that’s great! And since, you’re all set to begin the shooting, there’s one thing you must keep on your checklist as a pre-requisite, i.e. get the talent release form signed!

Basically, a talent release form is a legal document that authorizes the filmmaker to sell or distribute the film&#x2F;video after production that features your talent.</p><p> In other words, this legal document is specifically formulated and must be signed by the talent featured in the film&#x2F;video to protect you from getting sued.</p><p> For instance, let’s suppose, once the production has wrapped up and you’re all set to get the film&#x2F;video out for promotion or for any commercial purpose or release it digitally.</p><p> Your talent, out of the blue, goes cold feet and puts up a case on you for unauthorized utilization of someone’s image or voice.</p><p> This is where a talent release form (also termed as film release forms or video release forms) safeguards you from any such legal issues.</p><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-sign-up-a-talent-release-form"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-sign-up-a-talent-release-form" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: When to sign up a talent release form"></a>Part 2: When to sign up a talent release form</h2><p> Now, you’re well-versed with what a talent release form or an actor release form is and the purpose for it.</p><p> Therefore, in this section we’ll discuss about when to get a talent release form signed up.</p><p> Basically, you need to get a talent release form signed before the film&#x2F;video production starts. You’ll need it whenever you plan to sell the film&#x2F;video, or the rights to the production.</p><p> This is because the interested media company will require these talent releases before finalizing the deal.</p><p> You must ensure to obtain a talent release form from both primary actors and extras involved in that particular video production.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sign-talent-release-form.jpg"                      alt="sign up a talent release form"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-meant-by-talent-actually"><a href="#What-is-meant-by-talent-actually" class="headerlink" title="What is meant by talent actually?"></a>What is meant by talent actually?</h3><p> Usually, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/modeling/" >professional actors and models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are referred to as the term “talent”. This standard term is also utilized for unpaid or nonprofessional actors featuring in video or still photography.</p><p> Also, the pets or other animals are referred under this term.</p><p> When it comes to an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animated video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or radio advertisement or any other audio-only production where an actor (paid or unpaid), be it professional or nonprofessional, only furnishes his or her voice to the production. An individual talent is then required to sign a talent release form.</p><p> But, if in case, the talent aged below 18 years and is a minor, the parent or the legal guardian of the child is supposed to sign the release form.</p><p> And secondly, if an animal is the talent, the owner of the animal is required to get the release signed.</p><h3 id="When-you-do-not-require-a-talent-release-form"><a href="#When-you-do-not-require-a-talent-release-form" class="headerlink" title="When you do not require a talent release form?"></a>When you do not require a talent release form?</h3><ul><li>If you’re shooting a distant crowd scene where the people involved in the crowd cannot be identified, you don’t need to get a talent release form signed by them.</li><li>If the film&#x2F;video production is just for your personal use, then you don’t actually require a talent release form.</li></ul><p> However, you must always consider obtaining a talent release form, if by any chance the film&#x2F;video has to be exhibited in a film festival, contest, digitally (online platforms) or in the public.

Let’s take a look at some of the best photo watermarking software products you can use in 2021.</p><h4 id="1-iWatermark-Pro"><a href="#1-iWatermark-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. iWatermark Pro"></a>1. iWatermark Pro</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $30</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iwatermark-pro-photo-watermark-software.jpg"                      alt="Photo watermark software Iwatermark Pro"                ></p><p>This cross-platform watermarking app can be used with image editors like Lightroom, ACDSee or Photoshop or as a standalone app. Furthermore, iWatermark Pro is compatible with a broad range of digital cameras, so you don’t have to worry about file formats, as the app lets you import or export photos in JPEG, PNG, TIFF or RAW file formats. The software’s list of watermarking features includes options like Signature, Arc Text, StegoMark or Metadata that enable you to add visible and invisible watermarks to your photos and videos. iWatermark also offers batch processing feature so that you can simultaneously add watermarks with the exact same settings to multiple images.</p><h4 id="2-uMark"><a href="#2-uMark" class="headerlink" title="2. uMark"></a>2. uMark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, $29 for a full version of the software</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS</p><p>There are different options of the software available, so you can opt for uMark Photo Watermarker if you’re only working with photos or you can use uMark Video Watermarker in case you often upload videos to the Internet. The app lets you use both text and images as watermarks on your photos, and it also offers powerful batch processing options that automate the process of watermarking large amounts of images. In addition to conventional watermarking options, uMark also lets you watermark your photos with QR codes or different shapes. You can easily customize all the watermarks you create with this software or save them if you want to use them on future projects.</p><h4 id="3-Arclab-Watermark-Studio"><a href="#3-Arclab-Watermark-Studio" class="headerlink" title="3. Arclab Watermark Studio"></a>3. Arclab Watermark Studio</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start from $29 for a single computer license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Even though the number of options Arclab’s Watermark Studio provides is somewhat underwhelming, the software still offers all the tools you need to customize your watermark. You can choose the font, the size of the text or adjust the opacity of each watermark you create with Arclab Watermark Studio and even use logos as watermarks. The option to add multiple watermarks to a single image is also available as well as the batch processing feature that lets you apply the same watermark to an unlimited number of pictures. The Arclab Watermark Studio is equipped with image resizing tools which makes it a perfect choice for photographers who often post their work on social media.</p><h4 id="4-TSR-Watermark-Image"><a href="#4-TSR-Watermark-Image" class="headerlink" title="4. TSR Watermark Image"></a>4. TSR Watermark Image</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $29.95</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Professional photographers who have previous experience with photo editing software, won’t need too much time to get used to TSR Watermark Image. Besides the basic text and image watermarking options, the software also offers the 3D watermark feature. The images that were taken with Canon, Sony, Nikon, and numerous other cameras can also be watermarked through metadata. The TSR Watermark Image app provides a rich selection of special effects, borders, and crosses that let you create stylish watermarks. The free version of this photo watermarking software offers only a limited amount of options and if you want to gain access to more than 200 fonts or advanced uploading features you must purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><h4 id="5-Mass-Watermark"><a href="#5-Mass-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="5. Mass Watermark"></a>5. Mass Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $30 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>As its name suggests, Mass Watermark is designed to make the process of watermarking large quantities of photos quick and simple. In addition to powerful batch processing features this watermarking software for Mac and PC computers is equipped with Image Optimization tools that let you improve the overall quality of your photos before you apply a watermark to them. The app’s Watermark Designer lets you customize each watermark you create, while the Crop, Rotate and Resize features enable you to optimize your pictures for online use. What’s more, you can upload your photos to Flickr or your Picasa Web Album directly from Mass Watermark.</p><h4 id="6-Watermark-Software"><a href="#6-Watermark-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Watermark Software"></a>6. Watermark Software</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $24.90 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>The fact that you can watermark up to 300 photos in just one minute with this photo watermarking software speaks volumes about its capabilities. In fact, you can watermark all your photos with Watermark Software in just three easy steps, since you just have to import the images to which you want to add a watermark, insert text or picture you’d like to use as a watermark and wait for the app to process them. The Watermark Tiling feature makes unauthorized usage of your work even more difficult, while the EXIF editor enables you to add watermarks to a photo’s metadata. The free version of the app offers only a limited number of features, and you must purchase the lifetime license if want to use all the watermarking tools this app has to offer.</p><h4 id="7-Alamoon-Watermark"><a href="#7-Alamoon-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="7. Alamoon Watermark"></a>7. Alamoon Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Despite being slightly outdated, Alamoon Watermark software is still a reliable option for all photographers who are looking for a simple way to add watermarks to their photos. This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes. However, it lacks advanced watermarking and photo editing tools, so enhancing the colors in a photo or creating watermark templates is not possible with Alamoon Watermark app. The professional version of this watermarking software is largely overpriced and there are more powerful and more affordable options available.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Watermark"><a href="#8-Star-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Watermark"></a>8. Star Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start at $17 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Customizing each watermark you create with this cross-platform app is a straightforward process that won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can easily alter the size of the text, change its color, add shadows or position the text anywhere in the photo. Star Watermark enables its users to use images as watermarks or even create multilayered watermarks. The batch processing features, however, remain one of the most common reasons why professional photographers opt to use the Star Watermark software. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any of the advanced watermarking features, and it doesn’t allow you to use your digital signature as a watermark.</p><h4 id="9-Visual-Watermark"><a href="#9-Visual-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="9. Visual Watermark"></a>9. Visual Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $19.95 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Android</p><p>The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy. Besides watermarking photos, you can also use the Visual Watermark application to add watermarks to videos. There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.</p><h4 id="10-Water-Marquee"><a href="#10-Water-Marquee" class="headerlink" title="10. Water Marquee"></a>10. Water Marquee</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images. The process of adding a watermark to a photo with Water Marquee is remarkably simple, as you just have to upload a photo to the platform and click on the Add Text, Add Logo or Use Template option. You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background. When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?

Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, <strong>can you speed up Facebook videos</strong> still?</p><p>The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let’s discuss the <strong>Facebook video speed controller</strong> options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="add an extension for increasing video speed"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook"></a>The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook</h2><p>Multiple suitable solutions are available for users to try changing the Facebook videos they watch or play.

However, pulling off a successful live stream is quite challenging. You will have to get your script correct at the go, there are audio problems, and network issues are not ruled out. Where it all gets messed up is that you can’t edit if you make mistakes or an issue can slightly disrupt your stream. So, you have to be extra careful to do it successfully.</p><p>Fortunately, with the OneStream live streaming tool, you may not need to worry much because you can successfully and efficiently live stream a pre-recorded video. So, after recording your video and editing it to your taste, you can use OneStream to stream it as a live video to any social platform.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-OneStream-Live"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-OneStream-Live" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button.

The device offers a range of exciting features, including its generous battery life, outstanding appearance, enhanced telephoto camera, exceptionally smooth screen and innovative Face ID feature. Coming complete with a host of new and improved camera features, the iPhone X has helped Apple retain its reputation as one of the most pioneering and popular brands of all time. Let’s take a look at some of the0 <strong>best camera features</strong> the iPhone X has to offer right now.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The importance of depth</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to use portrait mode</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Video improvement</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera"><a href="#Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: TrueDepth Camera"></a>Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</h2><p> The phone has a brand new rear <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >camera with two lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a vertical orientation. This new orientation has been chosen to provide more space for the front-facing TrueDepth camera. This camera is tasked with powering the Face ID feature. The TrueDepth system also has a f&#x2F;2.2 7-megapixel camera for selfies. The feature means Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting are supported in front-facing mode. With Portrait Lighting, you can dynamically adjust your photo’s lighting with ease. TrueDepth uses an infrared emitter to project more than 30,000 in a recognised pattern onto users’ faces, before photographing the dots for analysis. The function is strengthened with a proximity sensor as well as an ambient light sensor which allows output light levels to be set.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-importance-of-depth"><a href="#Part-2-The-importance-of-depth" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The importance of depth"></a>Part 2: The importance of depth</h2><p> With previous versions of the iPhone Plus, the depth maps were only used to blur backgrounds and make subjects pop against them. However, the iPhone X takes the depth information from the two lenses as well as the efficiency of the A11 Bionic chip to offer outstanding new special effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/depth-iphone.jpg"                      alt="depth camera"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to use portrait mode"></a>Part 3: How to use portrait mode</h2><p> Portrait mode uses your iPhone X’s telephoto lens kit to create images with “bokeh”-esque backgrounds and foregrounds. Portrait Lighting also comes as part of the Portrait Mode with the iPhone X, utilising both machine learning and the depth map of Portrait mode to add exceptional lighting effects to your photos in real time. When you shoot in Portrait mode, the wide-angle measures the difference between what it and the telephoto can see to offer a multi-point depth map. The depth map itself creates artificial depth of field.</p><p> There are many iOS 11 Camera app features available that will help you make the most of Portrait mode, including flash, filters, HDR and timed photos. You can even create a live-type Portrait photo by recording the screen of your device whilst in the Camera app.</p><p> To take a photo of a person in Portrait mode, take the following steps.</p><ul><li>Open your Camera app</li><li>Swipe to the Portrait settings</li><li>Stand between two to eight feet of your subject, allowing the face and body detection feature to identify your subject.</li><li>Follow the app’s prompts, which can include “Flash may help”, “move farther away”, and “more light required” amongst others.</li><li>The banner at the bottom of your screen will turn yellow once you have met the instructions</li><li>Swipe or tap the cube icons above your shutter button to change the lighting effects if needed.</li><li>To take your photo, press the shutter button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PortraitLighting.jpg"                      alt="portrait lighting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Video-improvement"><a href="#Part-4-Video-improvement" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video improvement"></a>Part 4: Video improvement</h2><p> The iPhone X is also noted for its first-class video shooting capabilities, including its 4K video feature. Though previous iterations of the iPhone were already rather adept at shooting in 4K, the new devices are even more impressive and have been favourably compared to the GH5 in terms of quality and clarity. The new device has been complimented for its vibrant colour profile and its ability to deliver 4K video that matches a wide range of leading DSLR and mirrorless cameras.

The phone is the smallest yet to feature two 12MP rear-facing cameras, with the updated telephoto lens also being a big draw for many. The lens has been optically stabilised and had its aperture boosted to f&#x2F;2.4 from f&#x2F;2.8. The phone is now able to offer vastly superior performance in low-light conditions, with the sensor having been completely rebuilt and a brand new image signal processor offering stunning colours and textures. In fact, the phone is able to perform convincingly in low-light conditions even when there are multiple light sources competing.</p><p> The phone has also been praised for its wide range between light and dark colours. The Face ID function has proved to be incredibly secure, unlike earlier facial recognition systems which could easily be tricked by with the use of photographs or videos. It’s now possible to be more creative than ever with your iPhone’s camera whilst benefiting from a wealth of robust security features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902324/19272" target="_top" id="1902324">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902324" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902324/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-your-engagement-select-8-social-apps-for-facebook-fame/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevate Your Engagement Select 8 Social Apps for Facebook Fame</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevating-online-presence-with-obs-facebook-linking/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevating Online Presence with OBS-Facebook Linking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-next-gen-psvr-experience-essential-upcoming-games-to-watch/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Next Gen PSVR Experience Essential Upcoming Games to Watch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-vision-ai-photography-workshop/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate Vision AI Photography Workshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-disrupting-tradition-the-emerging-fb-ad-practices/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Disrupting Tradition The Emerging FB Ad Practices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/here-are-different-ways-to-find-pokemon-go-trainer-codes-to-add-to-your-account-on-apple-iphone-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Here are Different Ways to Find Pokemon Go Trainer Codes to Add to Your Account On Apple iPhone 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-gionee-f3-pro-frp-in-3-different-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Bypass Gionee F3 Pro FRP In 3 Different Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/mastering-inshot-adding-your-favorite-tunes/"><u>Mastering InShot Adding Your Favorite Tunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/the-runners-digital-dream-top-virtual-reality-walkers-for-2024/"><u>The Runner's Digital Dream Top Virtual Reality Walkers for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Zero-Cost-Green-Screens-for-Professionals"><a href="#Zero-Cost-Green-Screens-for-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="Zero-Cost Green Screens for Professionals"></a>Zero-Cost Green Screens for Professionals</h2><p>Videography and filmmaking require manipulative techniques to make things look real and captivating. Among the tools or techniques applicable in achieving this is a “green screen” in filmmaking. A green screen is the actualizing backbone of sci-fi movies and other related scenes in a movie. Green screen is likely the tool used in making the impossible possible in most of the movies you have seen in the past. The green screen works by imitating an easy and straight act of editing and manipulating originally recorded scenes. Some <strong>green screen templates are free</strong>; you do not need to learn video manipulation before you use <strong>green screen templates</strong> in filmmaking.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Green-Screen-templates"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Green-Screen-templates" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Green Screen (templates)"></a>Part 1: What is Green Screen (templates)</h2><p>The green screen is the underlying background for post-production effects in video making. Cinematography has developed: advanced technology is applicable in editing and customizing effects via “computer-generated imagery” (CGI). The CGI is the main tool facilitating video manipulation; however, the green screen is the aiding factor. CGI is not possible without green-screen effects. And this is why green screen templates are inevitable for all video makers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/green_screen.jpg"                      alt="green screen"                ></p><p>Green screen templates are ready-made effects free for use and downloadable. Unlike advanced videography, green screen templates do not require installation or a combination of software. You can use green-screen effects even from Filmora: an online video and image facilitating website.</p><p>Advantages of green screen templates include easy application, smooth editing, beginner-friendly, and cost-efficiency. A simple video editing costs a reasonable amount and effort; however, using a green screen template reduces cost and time. Many green screen templates are free on the web; learning about individual green screen templates and their unique feature improves productivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-green-screen-templates-on-your-videos"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-green-screen-templates-on-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use green screen templates on your videos"></a>Part 2: How to use green screen templates on your videos</h2><p>Green screen templates are available on reliable sources (for example, Filmora); you can create your green background yourself. The best way to use green screen templates is to apply ready-made templates on a platform; however, there are conditions where the right green template you want is unavailable. In this case, you must create the green screen video yourself.</p><h3 id="2-1-Download-green-screen-templates"><a href="#2-1-Download-green-screen-templates" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Download green screen templates"></a>2.1 Download green screen templates</h3><p>Downloading a suitable green screen template is the first thing to do. Ensure the green screen template fits the original video you want to overlay. Visit a template source, search “green screen” from the search space and select the right video that best represents your need&#x2F;original video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filmstock_green_screen.jpg"                      alt="filmstock green screen image"                ></p><p>You skip shooting the green background video yourself if you use a template. However, the ready-made video template may reduce quality production if you do not use the right green screen template. Keep the movement and element in mind while selecting a green screen template for your project: ensure the speed&#x2F;movement aligns with the original video elements.</p><h3 id="2-2-Import-the-video-background-and-green-screen-videos"><a href="#2-2-Import-the-video-background-and-green-screen-videos" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Import the video background and green screen videos"></a>2.2 Import the video background and green screen videos</h3><p>Import the two videos on Filmora: background and green screen; the background video replaces the green screen video. Start the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after you have installed it on your computer.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><ul><li>Click on “new file” and create a new program on Filmora.

Each feature contributes directly to your final result.

The HDRIs are available at a low resolution, but with a premium subscription, you can download high-resolution images.</p><h3 id="Hdri-Skies"><a href="#Hdri-Skies" class="headerlink" title="Hdri-Skies"></a><a class="link"   href="https://hdri-skies.com/" >Hdri-Skies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-2.jpg"                      alt="hdri skies"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.5&#x2F;5</p><p>Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location. It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.</p><p>Signing up with a free account allows a free, instant 2k download. However, 20k high-resolution images are behind a paywall and require a premium subscription before you can download them.

How to Edit the Video After Export from Funimate"></a>Part 3. How to Edit the Video After Export from Funimate</h2><p>Editing videos is a difficult undertaking, particularly if you don’t have the right tools. Filmora is about as versatile as it gets when it comes to video editing software. Filmora is Wondershare’s entry-level, simple-to-use, high-quality video editing software. 4k and gif support are now standard capabilities for most video editing tools, but titles are something Filmora excels at. There are many excellent video editing programs available, but few of them provide the combination of ease of use and capability that Wondershare Filmora does. To begin video editing, you must first import movies from your PC.</p><p>Overall, we feel Filmora is one of the most mind-blowing premium options accessible, especially when combined with other video-related tools from the company. The solution enables you to share instances or gatherings with your colleagues, as well as independently record the sound and video of your framework. The Filmora video editor now supports true 4k videos (both 3840*2160 and 4096*2160), as well as the creation of proxy files for a more fluid video editing experience. In Filmora, you may edit with proxy video files and subsequently export with the full-sized resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get Filmora Toolkit, Install It, And Run It</strong></p><p>To begin your editing experience with Filmora, first, visit the official website and download the most recent version of Wondershare Filmora.

Because Preview is also an editing software, you don’t need to look for any other third-party tool for basic photo and PDF manipulations.</p><p>That said, the sections below explain <strong>how to use Preview on Mac</strong> for elementary picture editing like rotating, cropping, adding annotations, etc.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Preview-to-Edit-Images-Complete-Guide"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Preview-to-Edit-Images-Complete-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Preview to Edit Images [Complete Guide]"></a>Part 1: How to Use Preview to Edit Images [Complete Guide]</h2><p>Being the default image editor for Mac, Apple tried to make the <strong>Preview app</strong> as simple as possible. Therefore, modifying the photos in the program isn’t much complicated as compared to its competitors from different vendors.</p><p>The instructions given in the following sections explain how to edit pictures with the <strong>Preview app for Mac</strong>:</p><h3 id="How-to-View-and-Edit-Photos-in-Preview-on-Mac"><a href="#How-to-View-and-Edit-Photos-in-Preview-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="How to View and Edit Photos in Preview on Mac"></a>How to View and Edit Photos in Preview on Mac</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the <strong>Preview app</strong> is a default photo viewer on Mac that also has many editing tools.

By default, Markup Tools is kept hidden, but automatically becomes visible when you make some changes to the image. However, you can follow the process given below to manually show Markup Tools in Preview:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Show Markup Tools</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>Show Markup Toolbar</strong> icon present at the upper-right area to reveal the editing tools right under the standard toolbar.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Hide Markup Tools</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>Hide Markup Tools</strong> icon from the upper-right area to hide <strong>Markup Toolbar</strong>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Throughout this demonstration, the <strong>Markup Toolbar</strong> is kept visible to access the editing tools easily.</p><h3 id="How-to-Crop-in-Preview"><a href="#How-to-Crop-in-Preview" class="headerlink" title="How to Crop in Preview"></a>How to Crop in Preview</h3><p>In order to crop a photo in the <strong>Preview app</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Image</strong></p><p>Use the method explained earlier to open the photo you want to edit in Preview.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Select the Area of Interest</strong></p><p>Drag the mouse pointer over the area of the photo you want to keep. If need be, click anywhere between the marked region and drag to reposition the selection. In addition, you can use any of the available side handles to adjust the area of interest on the image.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Crop the Photo</strong></p><p>Keeping the area of interest on the photo selected, click <strong>Crop</strong> from the <strong>Markup Toolbar</strong> at the top to crop the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Rotate-Image-in-Preview"><a href="#How-to-Rotate-Image-in-Preview" class="headerlink" title="How to Rotate Image in Preview"></a>How to Rotate Image in Preview</h3><p>Rotating an image in the <strong>Preview app</strong> is fairly simple. To do so:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Target Image</strong></p><p>Use the method explained above to open the photo in Preview.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Rotate the Image</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>Rotate Left</strong> icon from the upper-right area of the standard toolbar to rotate the image anticlockwise. Alternatively, you can also click <strong>Tools</strong> from the top, and choose your preferred rotation direction or flipping orientation from the menu that comes down next.</p><h3 id="How-to-Add-Text-to-Image-in-Preview"><a href="#How-to-Add-Text-to-Image-in-Preview" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Text to Image in Preview"></a>How to Add Text to Image in Preview</h3><p>The <strong>Preview app</strong> even lets you annotate the images with ease. To add text to a photo:</p><p><strong>Step1: Insert Text Frame</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>Text</strong> icon from the <strong>Markup Toolbar</strong>, drag the side handles to adjust the width of the text frame, and use the mouse to drag and reposition the entire frame to your preferred location on the photo.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Text</strong></p><p>Click inside the frame, delete the existing placeholder text, and type a new caption&#x2F;annotation for the picture.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Format the Text</strong></p><p>Select the text, click the <strong>Text Style</strong> icon from the <strong>Markup Toolbar</strong>, and change font, size, color, etc. using the available options.</p><h3 id="How-to-Remove-Background-in-Preview"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Background-in-Preview" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Background in Preview"></a>How to Remove Background in Preview</h3><p>As it is with some of the advanced image manipulation programs, even the <strong>Preview app</strong> allows you to remove background from a photo, and that too pretty easily. To get this done:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Select Unwanted Parts of the Image</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>Instant Alpha</strong> icon from the left area of the <strong>Markup Toolbar</strong>, click anywhere on the unwanted background on the image, and slowly drag the mouse. Notice the red colored coating that the image starts getting covered with. This is the portion that Preview will consider background and will remove. While dragging the mouse, if any section of the image that you want to keep gets red, drag the pointer to the opposite direction to deselect the area.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Remove the Background</strong></p><p>Once the background portion of the image gets selected (colored in red), without releasing the mouse button, press <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Removing background requires the image to be in PNG format. If the photo you are working on is JPG, Preview prompts with a confirmation box asking your permission to convert the photo from JPG to PNG. You must allow this conversion in order to proceed with the background removal process.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Usually, not entire background could be selected in a single go, especially when there are multiple objects in the photo. In such a situation, you must repeat the process multiple times to get rid of all the unwanted objects&#x2F;areas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144310/7443" target="_top" id="2144310">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144310" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144310/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Combine-Images-into-One"><a href="#How-to-Combine-Images-into-One" class="headerlink" title="How to Combine Images into One"></a>How to Combine Images into One</h3><p>This process is generally used to place an object present in one image over the background of the other photo. A good example could be to place a picture of a fish on to a second photo that has a sea or river. The <strong>Preview app</strong> lets you do this easily using the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Both the Images</strong></p><p>Drag mouse over both the images you want to participate in the process, right-click any one of the selected photos, go to <strong>Open With</strong>, and click <strong>Preview (default)</strong> from the submenu.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Remove Background from the First Image</strong></p><p>Ensure that Preview opens with both the images listed in the sidebar in the left. From the sidebar, select first image, and use the <strong>Instant Alpha</strong> tool as explained earlier to remove the background.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Combine the Images</strong></p><p>After removing the background, press <strong>Command</strong> + <strong>A</strong> to select all the remaining elements, and then press <strong>Command</strong> + <strong>C</strong> to copy them. Next, select the second photo from the sidebar, and press <strong>Command</strong> + <strong>V</strong> to paste the object to combine the pictures. Additionally, you can drag the pasted object or move its side handles to reposition or resize it respectively.</p><h3 id="How-to-Save-Images-in-Different-Formats"><a href="#How-to-Save-Images-in-Different-Formats" class="headerlink" title="How to Save Images in Different Formats"></a>How to Save Images in Different Formats</h3><p>The <strong>Preview app</strong> has a built-in image converter as well. To convert an image to a different format with Preview, you must:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Export Box</strong></p><p>After opening an image, click <strong>File</strong> from the menu bar at the top, and click <strong>Export</strong> from the menu that appears next.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose Output Format and Export</strong></p><p>Choose a destination folder in the <strong>Where</strong> field, select your preferred format from the <strong>Format</strong> drop-down list, and click <strong>Save</strong> to convert the image.</p><h3 id="Part-2-FAQs-About-Preview-App-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-FAQs-About-Preview-App-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: FAQs About Preview App on Mac"></a>Part 2: FAQs About Preview App on Mac</h3><h4 id="What-is-the-Preview-App"><a href="#What-is-the-Preview-App" class="headerlink" title="What is the Preview App?"></a>What is the Preview App?</h4><ol><li>Preview is a built-in program in macOS that works as a default image and PDF viewer, and is also equipped with some elementary editing tools.</li></ol><h4 id="Where-to-find-the-Preview-App-on-Mac"><a href="#Where-to-find-the-Preview-App-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Where to find the Preview App on Mac?"></a>Where to find the Preview App on Mac?</h4><ol><li>Usually, when you double-click an image or a PDF document, the <strong>Preview app</strong> is automatically initialized displaying the contents of the file.

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_Jk8a-_2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw_wcB" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes.

It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one.

To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151873/7443" target="_top" id="2151873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_Jk8a-_2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw_wcB" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_Jk8a-_2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw_wcB" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevating-your-ar-projects-with-custom-downloadable-luts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevating Your AR Projects with Custom, Downloadable LUTS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-easier-than-ever-2023s-fire-browser-addons-for-capturing-your-fb-videos/"><u>[New] Easier Than Ever 2023'S Fire-Browser Addons for Capturing Your FB Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-why-does-imovie-enforce-dimensions-in-2024/"><u>[New] Why Does iMovie Enforce Dimensions, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-screen-viewer-chromeos-edition/"><u>[Updated] Advanced Screen Viewer ChromeOS Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-navigating-the-complexities-of-online-video-rights-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Navigating the Complexities of Online Video Rights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/apples-leap-forward-the-game-changing-impact-of-the-mac-m1-chip/"><u>Apple’s Leap Forward: The Game-Changing Impact of the Mac M1 Chip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/effective-tips-and-tricks-for-resolving-mmi-2-sim-card-not-provisioned-error/"><u>Effective Tips and Tricks for Resolving 'MMI 2 - SIM Card Not Provisioned' Error</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/game-on-essential-samsung-gear-vr-experiences/"><u>Game On Essential Samsung Gear VR Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/in-2024-elite-images-cache-websites/"><u>In 2024, Elite Images Cache Websites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/share-and-post-like-a-pro-mastering-instagram-gif-uploads-4-step-method-for-2024/"><u>Share & Post Like a Pro Mastering Instagram GIF Uploads (4-Step Method) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-art-of-sideways-iphone-photography-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling the Art of Sideways iPhone Photography for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

So, changing the format such as <strong>AVI to GIF</strong> can be one of the solutions.</p><p>Instead of the full video, people can share short instances in playable GIF file formats on social media apps like WhatsApp, Tumblr, etc. GIF files have smaller sizes, play automatically on devices without any extra software compared to videos, and we can share them during conversations as reactions.</p><p>So, people opt for top apps to convert AVIs to the compressed GIF.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Innovative-Approaches-to-Video-Voiceover-Integration"><a href="#Innovative-Approaches-to-Video-Voiceover-Integration" class="headerlink" title="Innovative Approaches to Video Voiceover Integration"></a>Innovative Approaches to Video Voiceover Integration</h2><p>Ah, the infamous voiceover. Some filmmakers hate it – considering it a lazy method of telling a story. But it’s actually quite helpful to understand when, and how to include voiceovers and narrations in your video project.</p><p>And when you learn how to use this technique the right way, your YouTube videos will become more engaging and your watch time will shoot up.</p><p>I’ll be demonstrating how to add voiceovers and narrations in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to help you step up your video creation game.</p><h2 id="Voiceover-or-Narration"><a href="#Voiceover-or-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Voiceover or Narration?"></a>Voiceover or Narration?</h2><p>But first, what’s the difference between a voiceover and a narration? Truth be told, there is quite a bit of overlap between the two.</p><p>Typically, a voiceover is a technique used to impart some new information in a concise way, but narration generally conveys a storytelling aspect.</p><p>A voiceover is when the subject speaks but the screen has cut away from the person on screen. So the dialog is from a clear speaker, but the visuals have cut away to b-roll or other visual elements like a title slide.</p><p>On the other hand, a narration could be a different character speaking or an independent narrator as you would find in a novel.</p><p>From the layperson’s perspective, there is not much difference. In both situations, you are adding an audio-only track to your video project timeline.</p><p>The difference is more in terms of HOW you have chosen to tell your story on screen. It’s more of a stylistic distinction than anything else.</p><p>For the purpose of this article, I will be using the term “voiceover and “narration” interchangeably since they are both done the same way.</p><p>But here’s the good news: the way you add either option is the same in Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-01.png"                      alt="add either option"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-add-narration"><a href="#How-to-add-narration" class="headerlink" title="How to add narration"></a>How to add narration</h2><p>So the easiest way to add narration is directly to a project. The benefit of this is that you can record your narration inside Filmora while you watch the preview of your edited video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stt-tts-srt-09.png"                      alt="add narration to project"                ></p><p>A good example of this would be narrating a story on top of some still images and video clips from a recent vacation. (In most cases you would want to turn off the sound of the video clip, or at least use ducking to help the viewer focus on the narration.)</p><p>You put the playhead where you want to start recording and hit the microphone icon under the preview window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stt-tts-srt-08.png"                      alt="hit microphone icon"                ></p><p>A 3-second countdown will pop up and start recording immediately after this countdown.</p><p>You can record your narration and click stop.</p><p>After recording, you can trim and edit your narration, you can delete it and record it again, and can move it and edit it like any other feature.</p><h2 id="Some-Tips-for-Recording-Narration"><a href="#Some-Tips-for-Recording-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Some Tips for Recording Narration"></a>Some Tips for Recording Narration</h2><p>Try playing the clip in the preview window to get a sense of what you want to say fits well with the space available in the project.</p><p>Know what you want to tell your viewer rather than speak aimlessly. What can you do if your narration is too long?</p><p>You can edit pauses or weak parts out of the voiceover to trim it up. But if it is still too long, you can easily add another video clip, or even still images to help boost the length to match your narration.</p><p>Fortunately, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes equipped with video b-roll which is another great option. When using b-roll, it’s better to use multiple shorter clips than one longer clip in most cases. But adding the same b-roll clip near the beginning and another section of the same b-roll clip, later on, should help you match the length of your narration to the video timeline.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1838960/17916" target="_top" id="1838960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1838960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1838960/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Narration-is-a-great-storytelling-device"><a href="#Narration-is-a-great-storytelling-device" class="headerlink" title="Narration is a great storytelling device"></a>Narration is a great storytelling device</h2><p>Narration is a fantastic tool to have in your arsenal as a young filmmaker. It allows you to quickly communicate feelings, backstory, and context quickly and effectively.</p><p>Practice adding it to your videos to see how it adds depth and dimension to your videos.</p><p>It can also help make a connection with your audience because you can be relating to the images on the screen as they watch them. This is effective in building your YouTube audience.</p><h2 id="Always-use-a-good-mic"><a href="#Always-use-a-good-mic" class="headerlink" title="Always use a good mic"></a>Always use a good mic</h2><p>When adding voiceover or narration to your project, be sure to use a good USB microphone. A good quality sound will elevate your entire project and just requires a little planning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/use-good-microphone.jpg"                      alt="use good microphone"                ></p><p>Also, be sure to check that your external microphone is selected when you start recording. There’s nothing worse than nailing the perfect narration and realizing it was recorded with the built-in mic, not your USB microphone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915870/19272" target="_top" id="1915870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915870/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-you-use-narration-in-your-next-project"><a href="#Should-you-use-narration-in-your-next-project" class="headerlink" title="Should you use narration in your next project?"></a>Should you use narration in your next project?</h2><p>The best way to learn something is by doing it. So the next time you record a video, think about how you could augment your video project with narration.</p><p>You might feel a little odd recording a voiceover for the first time, but it allows you to communicate a lot of information quickly and clarify what might overwise be obscure – and good video is all about communicating your POV clearly and with brevity.</p><p>Filmora makes it easy to add narration of voice-overs to your video projects.

You still haven’t acted because of a limited budget. Well, in this article, we will share 5 tips and tricks to help you film at home. So let’s dive into it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Hack-DIY-A-Flag-for-Lighting-Control"><a href="#Part-1-Hack-DIY-A-Flag-for-Lighting-Control" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Hack. DIY A Flag for Lighting Control"></a>Part 1. Hack. DIY A Flag for Lighting Control</h2><p>When we set up the light near the subject, the light might be leaked onto the background. So, we may need to shape it to block the light from hitting the background.</p><p>On film sets and studios, the professionals use flags to absorb and make shapes of light. A flag is a thick black fabric that does not reflect light. To make your flag at home, you can try cardboard and a black t-shirt.</p><h3 id="1-A-Cardboard"><a href="#1-A-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="1. A Cardboard"></a>1. A Cardboard</h3><p>You can buy it from a nearby stationery store. Ensure the cardboard is not too big to fit the t-shirt around the board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-1.png"                      alt="cardboard used for diy flag"                ></p><h3 id="2-A-Black-T-shirt"><a href="#2-A-Black-T-shirt" class="headerlink" title="2. A Black T-shirt"></a>2. A Black T-shirt</h3><p>For the black t-shirt, you can use an old t-shirt that you don’t wear anymore. You can also find these shirts at your local thrift shop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-2.png"                      alt="black t-shirt for lighting control"                ></p><p>After managing all the required things, you must wrap and secure the t-shirt around the board. If the size of the t-shirt is larger than cardboard, tie the sleeves to secure the t-shirt. Or you can also use tape to secure the t-shirt and fasten it on the backside.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-3.png"                      alt="process for making diy flag"                ></p><p>With this DIY flag, you can now easily give shape and block the light while filming at home. <strong>Warnings:</strong> Some fabrics are not fireproof, so always keep an eye on the flag.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Final-Results-for-the-Flag-Light-Shaping"><a href="#Final-Results-for-the-Flag-Light-Shaping" class="headerlink" title="Final Results for the Flag Light Shaping"></a>Final Results for the Flag Light Shaping</h3><p>After filming the video, see the precise results before using the flag, when the light is dispersed everywhere, which makes a euphoric effect.

You can block light by directly giving shape to LED lightbulbs. The black wrap is made mainly of aluminum, so it’s easy to provide forms for different lights.</p><p>The aluminum foils used in households have the same characteristics as a black wrap, so that you can use it as an alternative. Look at the following requirement to make it! To make a black wrap, you need two household tools. There is no need to get pricey things from the market.

Do you want to fade in or out your video to black or white? Then, we have got you. Adobe Premiere Pro is one popular video editing software. Fading is every editor’s trump card, making it enjoyable to viewers by seamless scene transitions and some elements pop onto the screen. Fading is an effortless and beautiful effect that hep the clips to merge into the color of another clip smoothly. It is a way of telling viewers there is a visual change without explicitly telling them. The fade effect is in two forms fade in and fade out. Moreover, Fade-in appears at the beginning of the video and fade-out at the end of the video. And in this blog, we will discuss how to fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p>A fade-in refers to the technique that allows video&#x2F;image to emerge from the black, white, or any color background. In contrast, fade-out relates to the methods which will enable videos&#x2F;images to blend naturally into the black, white, or color background. We will also learn how to fade in video Premiere Pro.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Add Video fade in Premiere Pro](#Part 3)</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro</h2><p>Premiere Pro to add fade transition can be between clips to link and move from one shot to another shot smoothly. Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window &gt; Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/apply-transition.jpg"                      alt="apply transition"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions"><a href="#Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Single-Sided Transitions"></a>Step2 Single-Sided Transitions</h5><p>When you place the transition on a single cut, click on Ctrl + drag on the transition to the timeline. Release the mouse when the “End at Cut” or “Start at Cut” icon appears.</p><p>End At Cut: Adjust the end transition at the end of the first clip</p><p>Start At Cut: Adjust the start of the transition at the beginning of the first clip. This is another method to add fade in the Premiere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/start-and-end.jpg"                      alt="start and end"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-In-Out-sound-on-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-In-Out-sound-on-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro"></a>Part 2 Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro</h2><p>Are you in doubt about how to fade background music in Premiere Pro? A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain"><a href="#Constant-Gain" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power"><a href="#Constant-Power" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade"><a href="#Exponential-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out. In Premiere Pro, you will not find a fade option directly. It will appear as Film Dissolve in the settings of the Premiere Pro dashboard. Below is an example clip of how the video will look if you add black color fading effects. Let us discuss how to add video fade in Premiere Pro.</p><h5 id="Step-1-Choose-the-effect"><a href="#Step-1-Choose-the-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Choose the effect"></a>Step 1 Choose the effect</h5><p>To add fade in Premiere Pro, navigate Effects &gt; Video Transitions &gt; Dissolve &gt; Film Dissolve.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/film-dissolve.jpg"                      alt="film dissolve"                ></p><p>Fade in and out can be done using Film Dissolve found in the Video transitions folder.</p><h5 id="Step-2-Appling-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Step-2-Appling-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Appling Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Step 2 Appling Fade in&#x2F;out</h5><p>In Adobe Premiere, add Fade in or out, click and hold on Film Dissolve effect. Drag the Effect onto the video portion in the Timeline to create a fade-in effect drop at the beginning of the clip. To create a fade-out effect, drop at the end of the clip. After everything is automatic, you can clip on the Play button to see its action.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/applying-film-dissolve.jpg"                      alt="applying film dissolve"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects"><a href="#Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects"></a>Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects</h5><p>It is possible to change the length of the Fade in and out effects after the film dissolve is applied. You can notice that the Fade gets added between the clip. Inside the video, there is a small box. You can click on it drag their edges to increase the duration of the fade-in&#x2F;out in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/change-length.jpg"                      alt="change length"                ></p><p>Short video transitions are the best between the clips for most transitions. No one would like to wait between two scenes, but there are situations you might want to extend. This is how to add fade in the premiere.</p><h3 id="Tip-Fade-In-Out-Effects-with-Filmora"><a href="#Tip-Fade-In-Out-Effects-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Tip: Fade In&#x2F;Out Effects with Filmora"></a>Tip: Fade In&#x2F;Out Effects with Filmora</h3><p>There is many other professional editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro for Fade in&#x2F;out, but Wondershare Filmora offers the easiest and simple way. Same as premiere pro, Filmora fading effects is called Dissolve transition sometimes, lap dissolve transitions are a gradual smooth transition to move from one image to another. Filmora offers many transitions under ripple or dissolves categories like Dispersion blur, evaporate, ripple, wind, swirl, or wave. You can edit the duration of the transitions to get better results.

Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-1"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window &gt; Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/apply-transition.jpg"                      alt="apply transition"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-1"><a href="#Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Single-Sided Transitions"></a>Step2 Single-Sided Transitions</h5><p>When you place the transition on a single cut, click on Ctrl + drag on the transition to the timeline.

A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-1"><a href="#Constant-Gain-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-1"><a href="#Constant-Power-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-1"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-1" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out. In Premiere Pro, you will not find a fade option directly. It will appear as Film Dissolve in the settings of the Premiere Pro dashboard. Below is an example clip of how the video will look if you add black color fading effects.

Drag the Effect onto the video portion in the Timeline to create a fade-in effect drop at the beginning of the clip. To create a fade-out effect, drop at the end of the clip. After everything is automatic, you can clip on the Play button to see its action.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/applying-film-dissolve.jpg"                      alt="applying film dissolve"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects-1"><a href="#Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects"></a>Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects</h5><p>It is possible to change the length of the Fade in and out effects after the film dissolve is applied. You can notice that the Fade gets added between the clip. Inside the video, there is a small box. You can click on it drag their edges to increase the duration of the fade-in&#x2F;out in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/change-length.jpg"                      alt="change length"                ></p><p>Short video transitions are the best between the clips for most transitions.

Do you want to fade in or out your video to black or white? Then, we have got you. Adobe Premiere Pro is one popular video editing software. Fading is every editor’s trump card, making it enjoyable to viewers by seamless scene transitions and some elements pop onto the screen. Fading is an effortless and beautiful effect that hep the clips to merge into the color of another clip smoothly. It is a way of telling viewers there is a visual change without explicitly telling them. The fade effect is in two forms fade in and fade out. Moreover, Fade-in appears at the beginning of the video and fade-out at the end of the video. And in this blog, we will discuss how to fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p>A fade-in refers to the technique that allows video&#x2F;image to emerge from the black, white, or any color background. In contrast, fade-out relates to the methods which will enable videos&#x2F;images to blend naturally into the black, white, or color background. We will also learn how to fade in video Premiere Pro.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Add Video fade in Premiere Pro](#Part 3)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro</h2><p>Premiere Pro to add fade transition can be between clips to link and move from one shot to another shot smoothly. Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-3"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-3" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window &gt; Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/apply-transition.jpg"                      alt="apply transition"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-3"><a href="#Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-3" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Single-Sided Transitions"></a>Step2 Single-Sided Transitions</h5><p>When you place the transition on a single cut, click on Ctrl + drag on the transition to the timeline.

A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-3"><a href="#Constant-Gain-3" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power.

Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade.
