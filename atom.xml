Filmmakers are now able to create wonders with cinematic, jaw dropping results that were earlier just impossible in Hollywood productions. But if you are new to this world of drone then you must be searching for some information regarding how to shoot aerial videos using drone to get professional results. If so, then don’t worry! Because the article below will provide you complete information about impressive filming techniques with latest drones.</p><p> Let’s check a video tutorial first:</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone"><a href="#Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Filming with Drone"></a>Tips for Filming with Drone</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Techniques</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Weather</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Editing</a></li></ul><h3 id="Techniques"><a href="#Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Techniques"></a>Techniques</h3><p> In order to get best results with your aerial shoot, try these professional techniques:</p><h4 id="1-Go-Slow"><a href="#1-Go-Slow" class="headerlink" title="1.  Go Slow"></a>1.  Go Slow</h4><p> The very first recommendation to beginners from professionals is to move slowly. It leaves cinematic impression on viewers as your slow motion makes them think that you are shooting from a larger platform such as helicopter. No doubt, it will increase the production value and shots will appear perfectly crafted and well controlled.</p><p> Ensure that you operate RC control stick very smoothly. Take help from gradual movements so that undesired shakes in footage can be avoided and at the same time care about slow acceleration and deceleration to avoid distortion from end results.</p><p> It is good to pre-plan as well as visual most of your aerial shots. One should prefer to advance guard his filming location so that all pros and cons can be pre-observed and proper planning can be done to get rid of limitations of that area. If you know your requirements in advance and have an effective plan for the site then you will definitely be able to make most out of your limited battery life of drone. You will not feel happy if some shots are missed just because of mismanagement and drained drone battery.</p><h4 id="2-Two-Axis-type-Movement"><a href="#2-Two-Axis-type-Movement" class="headerlink" title="2.  Two Axis type Movement"></a>2.  Two Axis type Movement</h4><p> There are few hidden tricks behind those breathtaking shots of big budget movies and it is good to implement them with care. Most of those professionals prefer to implement two axis type movements simultaneously. They often make some arrangements to fly backwards as well as downwards at the same time but note that such movements must be controlled at much smoother rate with stable adjustments.</p><h4 id="3-Strafe"><a href="#3-Strafe" class="headerlink" title="3.  Strafe"></a>3.  Strafe</h4><p> When you have to focus on attractive landscapes then the best idea is to use sideways movements or the strafing feature. It will help you to show landscapes with different prospective and results will naturally be more impressive. Usually, most of the shots over landscapes in Hollywood movies are recorded with aerial motions where drone keep on moving forward and backward, so if you try the strafing effect then it will definitely be a unique and awesome idea. This recording style will also help you to reveal various eye catching features of the landscape.</p><h4 id="4-Orbit"><a href="#4-Orbit" class="headerlink" title="4.  Orbit"></a>4.  Orbit</h4><p> If you want to achieve Orbit then you have to control your drone strafe movements towards left or right side while pulling that yaw stick to exactly opposite direction. Let me make it clear that yaw stick is a control stick that you will find on left side of your drone controller and it is there to control rotation action of drone. Note that, you need to have more practice on that yaw control because most of users, even professionals end up spinning much faster and results are too bad.</p><h4 id="5-Fly-Through-Shots"><a href="#5-Fly-Through-Shots" class="headerlink" title="5.  Fly Through Shots"></a>5.  Fly Through Shots</h4><p> Here is something more cinematic but it is going to be risky enough. You need to be more careful to capture this type of shots because it demands you complete attention on controller screen for drone navigation. If you believe on your piloting skills then you will definitely achieve success in this recording action. When these shots are captured perfectly, they have power to capture attention of viewers and they will soon become fan of your cinematography skills along with your risk management strategy.</p><h3 id="Weather"><a href="#Weather" class="headerlink" title="Weather"></a>Weather</h3><p> When we talk about weather then it is something out of your control and you have just one option that is to pray mercy from Mother Nature. To capture some of the best shots you will often need to fly in a clean sky and you definitely don’t need that heavy fog and rain. This issue is more common in winter days, especially when you are working on high altitudes that get freeze due to cold.</p><p><strong>What to do?</strong></p><ul><li>The first most important trick is to avoid taking shots in windy day. Generally, most of the advanced drone units can bear the pressure of up to 25-35 mph wind but if it goes above this range then your footage will get spoiled. It is not a good idea to simply rely on post processing techniques like jello effect etc. However, few professionals are able to refine their shots with Wrap Stabilization Setting to get best results.</li><li>Choose golden hours of the day to shoot your footage. The time of sunset and sunrise will help your footage to stand out as shadows are highly visible during this time and it will naturally create a natural impact. People rarely shoot scenes at sunrise time so you can try to implement this trick to prove yourself different from those common aerial shooters.</li></ul><h3 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h3><p> Some of the most common camera settings that demand your focus are flat image profile and shutter speed.</p><ul><li>**Flat Image Profile:**There is no doubt to say that your camera settings are going to leave great impact on your footage so use them effectively. Prefer to work on flattest camera profile as it will help you to get impressive dynamic range with aerial camera. This technique of shooting helps users to prevent clouds and sky and also helps users to retain details from darkest point on ground.</li><li><strong>Control Shutter Speed:</strong><br> It is good to work with lower shutter speed and in order to avoid strobing effect one must prefer to shot by keeping camera close to ground. Keep it somewhere around 100th to 250th level of second, one can also work with ND filter to control shutter speed to desired lower level. In case if you work with 500th or 100th part of second then you will naturally obtain sharper frames with it leads to footage with heavy strobing.</li></ul><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p> If you need to edit your shots to get customized results then it is most important to choose a professional and high quality software tool. One of the best professional recommendations is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> due to its intuitive interface and ability to edit 4k video shoots. It can naturally lead to Hollywood style feeling with impressive adjustments of colours and other video effects.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Steps to edit videos using Wondershare Filmora:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1 Import video files:</strong> First of all you need to import your files from computer folder to main interface of Wondershare Filmora. You can either prefer to use the “Import” option directly or work with drag and drop functions that can bring all desired files immediately to software timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-main-interface-1.jpg"                      alt="import videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Cut Videos:</strong></p><p> Simply move the slider position to the specific point on your video from where you need to cut it down. In case if you want to remove any specific part permanently then split it using cut option and then use delete button from right menu or from toolbar to remove it. In case if you want to cut your video into multiple parts then simply repeat this process. But note that, you need to save those multiple sections of files one by one while deleting the unwanted portions.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Scene Detection:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection.jpg"                      alt="scene detection"                ></p><p> If you want to reach to certain segment of video quickly then use scene detection function. Just highlight your video on item tray and then right click, from the drop down menu, select “Scene Detection” option and now you can immediately separate your video into various parts as per need. It will help you to reach to specific part with ease.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Apply Effects:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-effects-in-filmora.jpg"                      alt="add effects"                ></p><p> Wondershare Filmora provides wide range of features and editing options. One can easily add transitions, filters, overlays, titles, text and other useful elements with ease. The filmora library contains about 500 effects along with free royalty music option.</p><p> <strong>Step 5: Export:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-output.jpg"                      alt="export"                ></p><p> Once you are done with the editing part and your video has reached to the satisfactory view then simply hit the create option to save your video. It is possible to export video to device with different file formats as per your need, for this you need to select the format option and then choose your desired type. In case if you wish to play your video on specific devices like iPod, iPad and iPhone etc then you need to click on Device option and then choose your device from available list. Videos can also be uploaded directly to social media platforms like YouTube etc and it can be burnt to DVD discs also so that you can enjoy them on TV screens with DVD player at home.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> Are you curious about which scenes in a film are shot by drones?

As the word ‘Focus’ itself defines as centre of interest, it helps to keep our image subject as the main part by emphasizing and giving attention to exactly what we want to capture in the image. But how many of you have come across a situation where iPhone camera focus fails to work. An out of focus photography clearly looks clumsy as due to the blurriness. The iPhone camera not focusing issue usually appears and many people get annoyed by unclear picture. Thus, with the help of this article, we will make you aware about some tips you can attempt to fix the issue.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part3: Stand too close is not good</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part4: Upgrade iOS</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part5: Turn off your iPhone</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-The-Easiest-Way—Auto-Focus"><a href="#Part1-The-Easiest-Way—Auto-Focus" class="headerlink" title="Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus"></a>Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus</h2><p> When you are getting troubles with iPhone camera focus, perhaps you are trying to focus a subject other than someone’s face. Putting it simply, iPhone camera’s autofocus feature is designed to make it powerful enough to read the face and focus it automatically. If there is no face, the iPhone will focus on the center itself. There is a yellow squared box which will let you identify the focusing part. But having the subject at the center is not necessary every time. If this is the case, you need to simply tap on the same part of the srceen where the subject is and the camera app will begin focusing on it. Check if it works or else go down to the next tip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/auto-focus.jpg"                      alt="auto focus"                ></p><h2 id="Part2-Lock-AE-AF"><a href="#Part2-Lock-AE-AF" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF"></a>Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF</h2><p> As in the above tip, we explained to tap on the srceen where you wish to set the focus. However, sometimes, single tapping on the srceen isn’t sufficient. This is because if any kind of movement happens in the scene or if you move, the camera will start re-adjusting its focus which obviously you don’t want. If you seriously want to take a better picture, make sure to lock the focus on the subject in the scene. This can be done by enabling AE&#x2F;AF feature and doing this will keep the focus on the subject even if anything moves in the scene. To do this, just tap and hold on the subject for a few seconds until you get to see a yellow box at the top of the srceen saying “AE&#x2F;AF LOCK”. Once you notice, you can release your fingers and start having fun with picture capturing moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ae-lock.jpg"                      alt="auto focus"                ></p><h2 id="Part3-Stand-too-close-is-not-good"><a href="#Part3-Stand-too-close-is-not-good" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Stand too close is not good"></a>Part3: Stand too close is not good</h2><p> If you are not getting standard iPhone focus, check if you are standing too near to the subject. Probably this is the case, and if yes, the problem of focus got the solution. Make sure to stand at least three inches apart from the subject. This is because the camera of iPhone is designed in a way that it can’t give you clear picture if it is placed too close to the subject. All in all, if you are holding your iPhone excessively close to the subject, pull it back little inches otherwise you will end up clicking a blurred photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/close.jpg"                      alt="stand too close"                ></p><h2 id="Part4-Upgrade-iOS"><a href="#Part4-Upgrade-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Part4: Upgrade iOS"></a>Part4: Upgrade iOS</h2><p> If you are still experiencing out of focus photography after giving try on the above solutions, the problem may have been occur due to the software. When iOS issues bother you and creating such problems, getting the latest iOS update typically solves the issues by removing any bugs and advancing the performance. Hence, it is recommended to update your iOS into the latest version when you are stuck with this iPhone focus issue. To execute this method, just head on to “Settings” &gt; “General” &gt; “Software Update” and look for the updates. You will be able to observe if there is any new update available. If yes, tap on “Install Now”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/upgrade-ios.jpg"                      alt="upgrade ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part5-Turn-off-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part5-Turn-off-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part5: Turn off your iPhone"></a>Part5: Turn off your iPhone</h2><p> If still the problem persists after using all the fixes, you can try turning off your device as a last resort. This will probably solve your problem and has worked in many cases. If in case it doesn’t work either, the last suggestion we could give you is, stepping towards the nearest Apple support center and consulting there. As they say that the work suits in the hands of the one who is skilled to do it. So, an expert at the iPhone customer service will surely understand the problem and will fix your issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/turn-off-iphone-ios.jpg"                      alt="turn off iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p> When owning an electronic gadget, many unpredictable issues can occur and you get stuck with any of those without getting any notice.

So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p><p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its own voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p><p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p><p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p><ol><li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li><li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li><li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li><li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li></ol><p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuations loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Top-5-Dragon-for-Mac-1"><a href="#Part-5-Top-5-Dragon-for-Mac-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac"></a>Part 5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/dragon-for-mac-5.jpg"                      alt="top 5 dragon for mac"                ></p><p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learns how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p><p>Dragon for Mac users report a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech to text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-6-FAQs-1"><a href="#Part-6-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: FAQs"></a>Part 6: FAQs</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text-1"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text-1" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?"></a>Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?</h3><p>Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech to text functionality.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Rapid-DIY-Filming-Ideas-for-Aspiring-Directors"><a href="#Rapid-DIY-Filming-Ideas-for-Aspiring-Directors" class="headerlink" title="Rapid DIY Filming Ideas for Aspiring Directors"></a>Rapid DIY Filming Ideas for Aspiring Directors</h2><p>Have you ever wanted to film from home but missing some filming gear? You still haven’t acted because of a limited budget. Well, in this article, we will share 5 tips and tricks to help you film at home. So let’s dive into it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Hack-DIY-A-Flag-for-Lighting-Control"><a href="#Part-1-Hack-DIY-A-Flag-for-Lighting-Control" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Hack. DIY A Flag for Lighting Control"></a>Part 1. Hack. DIY A Flag for Lighting Control</h2><p>When we set up the light near the subject, the light might be leaked onto the background. So, we may need to shape it to block the light from hitting the background.</p><p>On film sets and studios, the professionals use flags to absorb and make shapes of light. A flag is a thick black fabric that does not reflect light. To make your flag at home, you can try cardboard and a black t-shirt.</p><h3 id="1-A-Cardboard"><a href="#1-A-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="1. A Cardboard"></a>1. A Cardboard</h3><p>You can buy it from a nearby stationery store. Ensure the cardboard is not too big to fit the t-shirt around the board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-1.png"                      alt="cardboard used for diy flag"                ></p><h3 id="2-A-Black-T-shirt"><a href="#2-A-Black-T-shirt" class="headerlink" title="2. A Black T-shirt"></a>2. A Black T-shirt</h3><p>For the black t-shirt, you can use an old t-shirt that you don’t wear anymore. You can also find these shirts at your local thrift shop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-2.png"                      alt="black t-shirt for lighting control"                ></p><p>After managing all the required things, you must wrap and secure the t-shirt around the board. If the size of the t-shirt is larger than cardboard, tie the sleeves to secure the t-shirt. Or you can also use tape to secure the t-shirt and fasten it on the backside.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-3.png"                      alt="process for making diy flag"                ></p><p>With this DIY flag, you can now easily give shape and block the light while filming at home. <strong>Warnings:</strong> Some fabrics are not fireproof, so always keep an eye on the flag.</p><h3 id="Final-Results-for-the-Flag-Light-Shaping"><a href="#Final-Results-for-the-Flag-Light-Shaping" class="headerlink" title="Final Results for the Flag Light Shaping"></a>Final Results for the Flag Light Shaping</h3><p>After filming the video, see the precise results before using the flag, when the light is dispersed everywhere, which makes a euphoric effect. While after using the flag, the light is only glimpsing the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-4.png"                      alt="results after using diy flag for lighting control"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Hack-DIY-Black-Wrap-or-Cinewrap"><a href="#Part-2-Hack-DIY-Black-Wrap-or-Cinewrap" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Hack. DIY Black Wrap or Cinewrap"></a>Part 2. Hack. DIY Black Wrap or Cinewrap</h2><p>The black wrap is used in professional studios and set up to block and shape light. You can block light by directly giving shape to LED lightbulbs. The black wrap is made mainly of aluminum, so it’s easy to provide forms for different lights.</p><p>The aluminum foils used in households have the same characteristics as a black wrap, so that you can use it as an alternative. Look at the following requirement to make it! To make a black wrap, you need two household tools. There is no need to get pricey things from the market. For this, follow the below outlines of the tools!</p><h3 id="1-A-Light-Bulb"><a href="#1-A-Light-Bulb" class="headerlink" title="1. A Light Bulb"></a>1. A Light Bulb</h3><p>You can take any LED bulb present at our home. Ensure that the bulb size is manageable to avoid any issues handling it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-5.png"                      alt="lightbulb used for cinewrap"                ></p><h3 id="2-Foil-Paper"><a href="#2-Foil-Paper" class="headerlink" title="2. Foil Paper"></a>2. Foil Paper</h3><p>The foil paper used to cover the lightbulb should be aluminum because foils usually absorb the light and get fired. In contrast, aluminum foil is resistant and doesn’t produce too much heat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-6.png"                      alt="foil paper used in the black wrap"                ></p><p>Now, all the tools are ready and waiting for further processing. For this, follow the processing step to make it work. To proceed further, you have to follow the below step-by-step process as shown:</p><p>Step1 First, carefully wrap the bulb with the foil paper to shape the light.</p><p>Step2 Then, you need to install the bulb on the lamp.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> During wrapping, you don’t have to allow the foil to touch the bottom part of the bulb.</p><p>Step3 Leave a small part of the bulb open from the top and cover the part from the side.</p><p>Step4 Ensure the lamp switch is off, and install the light bulb.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-7.png"                      alt="process of creating a black wrap"                ></p><p>When you turn on the lamp, the light has been shaped into a smaller light source.</p><h3 id="Final-Results-for-the-Black-Wrap-or-Cinewrap"><a href="#Final-Results-for-the-Black-Wrap-or-Cinewrap" class="headerlink" title="Final Results for the Black Wrap or Cinewrap"></a>Final Results for the Black Wrap or Cinewrap</h3><p>You can observe that the light is only at the required place, with no dispersion observed and no scattering. You can create more shapes to foil and then wrap them on the bulb for a different look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-8.png"                      alt="results after using cinewrap"                ></p><p>After experimenting with light shaping and blocking hacks, we will move toward the light reflector hack!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Hack-DIY-Light-Reflector"><a href="#Part-3-Hack-DIY-Light-Reflector" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Hack. DIY Light Reflector"></a>Part 3. Hack. DIY Light Reflector</h2><p>A reflector is a spontaneous or specialized reflective surface that diverts the light to our subject or object. Professional filming setups usually use a large reflector to get a glowing effect on a subject or even more than two.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-9.png"                      alt="light reflector used in a professional setup"                ></p><p>When applied to flat surfaces, the foil has a reflective surface. It makes it the best alternative to a professional reflector. To make your one, you will need</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-swiftly-move-data-fast-and-reliable-methods-to-direct-files-onto-your-computer/"><u>2024 Approved  Swiftly Move Data  Fast and Reliable Methods to Direct Files Onto Your Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-fiscally-friendly-celestial-saving-service-for-files/"><u>2024 Approved  The Fiscally Friendly Celestial Saving Service for Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/maximizing-traffic-with-effective-youtube-titles/"><u>Maximizing Traffic with Effective YouTube Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-stand-out-in-the-stream-top-name-generators-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] Stand Out in the Stream  Top Name Generators Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-practices-aspect-ratio-in-twitters-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Practices  Aspect Ratio in Twitters Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/step-by-step-mastery-of-video-filters-in-zoom-for-2024/"><u>Step-by-Step Mastery of Video Filters in Zoom for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-leading-examples-of-5-innovative-social-sites-animations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Leading Examples of 5 Innovative Social Sites Animations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/boost-device-compatibility-with-updated-windows-mf4770n-drivers/"><u>Boost Device Compatibility with Updated Windows MF4770n Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/360-aerial-panoramas-with-yuneec-breeze-drone-review-for-2024/"><u>360 Aerial Panoramas with Yuneec Breeze Drone Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-useful-guide-to-speed-updown-videos-in-vlc/"><u>New Useful Guide to Speed Up/Down Videos in VLC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/expert-ff-video-extractor-kit-efficient-file-grabbing-firefox-compatibility/"><u>Expert FF Video Extractor Kit  Efficient File Grabbing, Firefox Compatibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-obs-overpower-vs-streamlabs-supremacy-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] OBS Overpower Vs.

As a general rule, employing a strong physical connection is quicker than simple methods (such as switching hard drives or transferring over LAN) (like moving files over Wi-Fi or using a USB drive).</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-options-to-transfer-files-from-one-computer-to-another.jpg"                      alt="transfer data from pc to pc"                ></p><h2 id="1-Transfer-cable"><a href="#1-Transfer-cable" class="headerlink" title="1. Transfer cable"></a>1. Transfer cable</h2><p>You require a USB bridge cable or USB networking cable for computer-to-computer transfer. Since the copy-and-paste operation occurs simultaneously between the connected systems, it is quicker than utilizing disks. You essentially move data between three drives when using external drives, but cables only allow for two drives.</p><p><strong>Windows to Windows</strong></p><p>Connect the USB cord to both Windows machines if you’re moving files between them. Wait until the cable is detected by both computers and the drivers are installed automatically. Download and install the data transfer software for both computers after installing the USB cable’s driver. Once everything is set up, start the file transfer program on both computers and start sharing data.</p><p><strong>Mac to Mac</strong></p><p>Using the exclusive Thunderbolt connector, two Mac computers can be linked. Once you’ve done so, the machines ought to recognize one another, and moving files between them is as easy as dragging and dropping. Windows, Mac, and Linux to Windows, Mac, and Linux Without a router, create a local area network using an Ethernet connection. Make sure the Ethernet cable is a crossover type, meaning the color patterns on each end are different from one another. You can move files across computers by setting up network sharing on both of them.</p><h2 id="2-Cloud-storage-and-web-transferring"><a href="#2-Cloud-storage-and-web-transferring" class="headerlink" title="2. Cloud storage and web transferring"></a>2. Cloud storage and web transferring</h2><p>The most convenient alternative for transferring files across PCs is to use the internet. This is likely the simplest method for syncing information between computers because more and more users are now saving their files to cloud storage. However, depending on the speed of your internet connection, this could take a while—anywhere from a few minutes to several days.</p><p>You can pick from a number of cloud storage companies, including Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. Each performs the task just as well as the other. If you have enough capacity, cloud drivers are a great choice because the size of the files is practically limitless. Additionally, if local folder sync is enabled on both machines, download and upload of data will occur simultaneously.</p><p>But if speed is what you’re after, consider FilePizza. Its peer-to-peer nature sets it apart from other apps. Thus, as soon as one computer uploads a file, another computer instantaneously downloads it. Between the two, there is no waiting time. You also don’t have to use the same cloud drive subscription. Everything is in the browser.</p><h2 id="3-Using-external-storage-media"><a href="#3-Using-external-storage-media" class="headerlink" title="3. Using external storage media"></a>3. Using external storage media</h2><p>This is how most people go about doing it. Copy the data onto a USB flash drive and insert it into one machine. Copy the data, then insert the identical drive into the other computer. Simple. If you have more data than a flash drive can hold, you might also utilize an external hard disk.</p><p>If the USB 3.0 connections on both machines are available, you might want to buy a fast flash drive. Speed becomes crucial when you need to move a lot of data. But there is a faster way to accomplish this.</p><p>First, determine whether the computer to which you wish to transfer data has an available SATA slot or an eSATA connector. If so, unplug the hard disk from the first computer and plug it into the second one. Once finished, it will show up on the target PC as another drive. Then, using SATA, which is significantly quicker than USB, you can transport data.</p><h2 id="4-Using-Wi-Fi-or-LAN"><a href="#4-Using-Wi-Fi-or-LAN" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Wi-Fi or LAN"></a>4. Using Wi-Fi or LAN</h2><p>There are two major methods for sharing files and folders across computers that are close to one another. To browse the hard drives of other PCs, you must first set up a local area network (LAN). Utilizing software to transmit files over Wi-Fi is the second option.</p><p>A built-in option for creating a home network is included in all the main operating systems. This enables Ethernet- or Wi-Fi-connected devices on the same router to recognize one another indefinitely. As long as both computers are turned on, you can transfer data between them without having to establish a new connection each time.</p><h2 id="5-Connecting-the-HDD-or-SSD-manually"><a href="#5-Connecting-the-HDD-or-SSD-manually" class="headerlink" title="5. Connecting the HDD or SSD manually"></a>5. Connecting the HDD or SSD manually</h2><p>Standard SATA cables are used to connect hard disk drives (HDD) and some Solid-State Drives (SSD) to the motherboard. Connect your old hard drive to a spare SATA or eSATA (external SATA) port if you have one. It will be acknowledged as a new drive by the operating system. then begin the transfer.</p><p>It is the quickest option available. On a laptop, it’s challenging to find an extra SATA port, unlike a PC. To extract data from your hard drive, you could instead use alternative methods such an external enclosure or a USB docking station. Either way, learning how to move files from one laptop to another is simple.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Any one of these techniques will enable you to swiftly move files from PC to PC if you have ever wondered, “How do I transfer files from one computer to another?” Remember that cable connections between computers are preferable when transporting large amounts of data. However, if the amount of data is only a few gigabytes, feel free to choose one of the wireless solutions.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"

Most of the professionals advise to invest on good quality camera lenses because they offer longer lifespan. You will be glad to know that lenses that have been designed years ago can be easily mounted on latest camera units and they still ensure outstanding results.</p><p> Those who are planning to buy new camera lenses may be little confused while making understanding for the basic specifications and features. If so, then the article below can be helpful for you as it contains details about best lenses for 4k cameras.</p><h2 id="How-to-choose-the-right-lens-for-your-4k-Camera"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-lens-for-your-4k-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?"></a>How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?</h2><h4 id="1-Lens-Mount"><a href="#1-Lens-Mount" class="headerlink" title="1.Lens Mount"></a>1.Lens Mount</h4><p> One of the most essential accessories for your camera lenses are mounts. All designers offer different mount systems for attaching lenses to the cameras so you can easily find a wide range of mount systems that are dedicated for DSLRs or to the mirror less systems like Micro Four Thirds, Sony E Mount, Nikon F and Canon EF. Few latest lenses also offer advanced features like making electrical contacts so that lens information gets automatically transferred to camera circuitry. It can also have a square type groove in the middle portion that works like a holder for filters.</p><h4 id="2-Sensor-Size"><a href="#2-Sensor-Size" class="headerlink" title="2. Sensor Size"></a>2. Sensor Size</h4><p> One more essential factor that demands your attention at the time of lens purchase is the camera sensor format. You can find a wide range of sensors in market ranging between Micro Four Thirds, Crop Sensors and Full Frame type. The full frame sensors use to be the largest ones and they are designed to cover the full frame and they ensure larger image size even on smaller sensors. But, in case if you prefer to use a crop type sensor on your full frame camera then it will deliver an image as per size of sensor only. The idea is to avoid using smaller sensors on a large format type camera but in few special cases when you want to access certain specific look then they can be connected.</p><h4 id="3-Lens-Adapters"><a href="#3-Lens-Adapters" class="headerlink" title="3. Lens Adapters"></a>3. Lens Adapters</h4><p> If you have lens that is dedicated to work with certain specific mount type but now need to connect it on different mount then lens adapter can solve your trouble. You can find these adapters for all mount types but still there are few cons hidden behind their usage. Most of these adapters block the ability of digital communication between lenses and camera. The fact is that when you lose the digital contact then it is not possible to access autofocus feature; even the new lenses may also suffer with inability to adjust the aperture. Adapters also cause disturbance to the light that passes from lens to sensor that reduces the quality of exposure.</p><h4 id="4-Focal-Length"><a href="#4-Focal-Length" class="headerlink" title="4.Focal Length"></a>4.Focal Length</h4><p> Here is one more important factor that you need to consider while buying camera lenses. Your will find camera focal length as first most parameter listed in the specification list of the device. This length is measured on millimetres scale and when it has lower value that means you will have wider viewing angle; naturally it will capture a wide scene. When lenses have longer focal length then viewers are able to find themselves nearer to the field they are shooting. Generally, the prime lenses offer fixed focal length value but zoom lenses offer a wider range.</p><h2 id="Best-Lenses-for-4k-Camera-Professional-Production"><a href="#Best-Lenses-for-4k-Camera-Professional-Production" class="headerlink" title="Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production"></a>Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production</h2><p> First of all, let us collect an idea about the major differences between still and cine lenses as it will help you to make better decision.

Use Long Exposures"></a>1.  Use Long Exposures</h4><p> The exposure is the amount of time the camera’s sensor is exposed to light. If you are taking a photo in broad daylight exposure value is going to 1&#x2F;800 of a second or even less, while if you find yourself in a situation where light is scarce the exposure value should be anywhere between 3 to 30 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/long-exposure-iphone.jpg"                      alt="long-exposure-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: iOS Gadget Hacks</p><p> In low light scenes, the long exposure will help your camera gather more light. However, long exposures can produce grainy photos.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Sure-that-Your-iPhone-is-Perfectly-Still"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-that-Your-iPhone-is-Perfectly-Still" class="headerlink" title="2.  Make Sure that Your iPhone is Perfectly Still"></a>2.  Make Sure that Your iPhone is Perfectly Still</h4><p> Any camera shake that occurs while the camera shutter is open will result in blurry photos. The exposure value you set determines how long the shutter is going to be open.</p><p> Holding a camera still for a long period of time is impossible, which is the reason why you should get a tripod if you want to take sharp night photos. Finding other ways to keep your iPhone steady, such as placing it on a firm, flat surface is also an option.</p><h4 id="3-Experiment-with-Ambient-Light-and-Shadows"><a href="#3-Experiment-with-Ambient-Light-and-Shadows" class="headerlink" title="3.  Experiment with Ambient Light and Shadows"></a>3.  Experiment with Ambient Light and Shadows</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/golden-hour-photo.jpg"                      alt="golden-hour-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: Contrastly</p><p> A good photographer always comes up with ways to work with what they’ve got, so instead of trying to avoid shadows and ambient lights, embrace them and make them a part of your photo. By doing so, you’ll be able to contribute to an overall impression of realism in a photo, and at the same time, you’ll create photos that have strong contrasts.</p><h4 id="4-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Backlighting"><a href="#4-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Backlighting" class="headerlink" title="4.  Find Creative Ways to Make Good Use of Backlighting"></a>4.  Find Creative Ways to Make Good Use of Backlighting</h4><p> Taking photos by night means that you’re going to have a source of light in your shot. Backlight or a source of light in the background of your photo will enable you to get creative and capture people or objects in front of window shops, street lights or any other light source you can fathom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/backlight-photography.jpg"                      alt="backlight-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Coles Classroom</p><h4 id="5-Utilize-Different-Sources-of-Light-to-Illuminate-the-Subject-of-a-Photo"><a href="#5-Utilize-Different-Sources-of-Light-to-Illuminate-the-Subject-of-a-Photo" class="headerlink" title="5.  Utilize Different Sources of Light to Illuminate the Subject of a Photo"></a>5.  Utilize Different Sources of Light to Illuminate the Subject of a Photo</h4><p> The cities offer countless artificial sources of light during the night, so coming up with creative ways to incorporate these light sources into your night photos is a part of the creative challenge of night photography. Place the subject of your photo into a well-lit area, and try to surround it with a dark negative space in order to create a high contrast photo.</p><h4 id="6-Convert-Your-Night-Photos-to-Black-and-White"><a href="#6-Convert-Your-Night-Photos-to-Black-and-White" class="headerlink" title="6.  Convert Your Night Photos to Black and White"></a>6.

Night photos often have strong contrasts of light and dark, and by converting your images to black and white you’ll be able to highlight this contrast even more.</p><p> It is easy to fall in love with black and white images, which is why it is important to make sure that your picture actually looks better when desaturated before sharing it with your friends.</p><h2 id="3-Best-Slow-Shutter-Camera-Apps-for-iPhones"><a href="#3-Best-Slow-Shutter-Camera-Apps-for-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="3 Best Slow Shutter Camera Apps for iPhones"></a>3 Best Slow Shutter Camera Apps for iPhones</h2><p>| App                   | Price                                                                                                        |  |<br>| ——————— | ———————————————————————————————————— |  |<br>| Slow Shutter Cam      | <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slow-shutter-cam/id357404131?mt=8" >$1.99 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>                                   |  |<br>| Slow Shutter Fast Cam | <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/slow-shutter-insta-free-long-exposure-photo-cam-for/id730352755?mt=8" >Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |  |<br>| LongExpo              | <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/longexpo-slow-shutter-and-long-exposure-camera/id594078421?mt=8" >Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>      |  |</p><h4 id="1-Slow-Shutter-Cam"><a href="#1-Slow-Shutter-Cam" class="headerlink" title="1.

Each mode lets you create a different type of a long exposure photo that will look like you used professional DSLR camera equipment to capture it.</p><h4 id="2-Slow-Shutter-Fast-Cam"><a href="#2-Slow-Shutter-Fast-Cam" class="headerlink" title="2.

The app lets its users adjust contrast, a feature that is particularly useful if you want to take a black and white night photo.</p><h4 id="3-LongExpo"><a href="#3-LongExpo" class="headerlink" title="3.
