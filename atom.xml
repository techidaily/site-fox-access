If you are so excited about updating your software but you are not sure how to get started, you have come to the right page. Here are the biggest tips and tricks that you can use to enjoy the hidden features brought to you by Windows 10:</p><h4 id="1-Personalize-the-Start-Menu"><a href="#1-Personalize-the-Start-Menu" class="headerlink" title="1. Personalize the Start Menu"></a>1. Personalize the Start Menu</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>The start menu of Windows 10 is now resizable. It can be quote odd for many but it is really surprising to know that with Windows 10, you can now customize the start menu and change its size to the extent you want. You now have the option to make it taller or wider as you like. If you wish to have the start menu taking up the whole left portion of the screen of your laptop or you want a thin strip transversely the taskbar, well that is now possible with Windows 10. The taskbar is also resizable and that means you have the ability to some weird and pretty cool stuff with your device. You will surely find that having a resizable Start Menu is cool.</p><h4 id="2-Using-Cortana-in-Windows-10"><a href="#2-Using-Cortana-in-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="2. Using Cortana in Windows 10"></a>2. Using Cortana in Windows 10</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is finally here in Windows 10, taking control of the search functions as well as dishing out as much sass of the operating system in the same way with Windows Phone edition. On the other hand, by default, it will never listen and follow your commands.</p><p>If you would like to have the ability to simply bark commands at your personal computer, you launch Cortana through hitting the search field within the taskbar and then choose the Notebook icon in the left side choices pane. You choose “settings” from the list and have the “Let Cortana respond when you say ‘Hey Cortana’” choice. You will have an active and working microphone for it to work.</p><p>While you are poking around the Cortana’s options, you may dive in the Notebook menu so you can fine-tune exactly what data the digital assistant of Microsoft can open. On the other hand, you should bear in mind that like Google, the effectiveness of Cortana is related directly to how much it knows regarding you.</p><h4 id="3-Additional-Apps-you-should-try"><a href="#3-Additional-Apps-you-should-try" class="headerlink" title="3.

Though they are good apps to use when you want to get started in using Windows 10, Microsoft is likewise making available the preview of touch-friendly editions of Microsoft Word, Excel as well as the PowerPoint. All of these are known to be universal apps and that means similar code is running on the phones, PCs and tablets.</p><p>On the other hand, Microsoft did not release similar apps that are optimized for tablets and phones as of now. These apps don’t come with Windows 10 yet you may download the new apps through the Store. Microsoft will also release the Music Preview and also the Video Preview applications. These apps are designed to replace the present Video and Music apps in Windows 8.1. These two will be introducing a brand new look which complements the design that Microsoft tries to implement across different apps all over the OS.</p><h4 id="4-New-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#4-New-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="4.

With that, the program window would move to the top quadrant at the right side of the screen.</p><p>Windows Key-Tab open and leaves open the new task view to show all the running and working programs as well as the virtual desktops. To make the latest virtual desktop, you can use the Windows Key-Ctrl-D. Windows Key-C will get Cortana listening and following your voice input then the Windows Key-S will open its daily glance to showcase the weather, news and sports.

You right click the app you want to transfer from a virtual desktop to the other, choose “Move To” and then you move the app to the desktop where it should go.</p><p>With Windows 10, it is now easy to create several desktops as well as run applications from each, so every desktop is showing only those apps that are running in a particular virtual desktop. In case that you do not want to make use of this feature, you may simply remove the “Task View” button.</p><h4 id="6-New-Mail-App"><a href="#6-New-Mail-App" class="headerlink" title="6.

In case the previous century was considered to be the age of mass production and the growth of the internet, the 21th century will be known for the development and expansion of the virtual world. One of the products of this technological evolution is the Metaverse. This is what we are going to take a look at in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What a Metaverse Could Look Like?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What Can You Do in the Metaverse?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">What to Prepare Before Joining the Metaverse?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-a-Metaverse-Could-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-1-What-a-Metaverse-Could-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?"></a>Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?</h2><p>Metaverse is a combination of different technological elements, including AR, VR, and video where the users live inside a virtual universe.

Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.</p><p>Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?"></a>Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?</h2><p>Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.</p><h3 id="1-Ready-Player-One"><a href="#1-Ready-Player-One" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, before you start sharing your tunes, you must ensure you understand its music copyright rules.</p><p>In this article, we’ll give you a comprehensive guide to understanding <strong>Instagram’s rules about copyright music.</strong> We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the system is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>Here’s what happens to your Instagram account if the system detects copyrighted content:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copyright-music-on-instagram-1.jpg"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:</p><ul><li><strong>Apply A Video When Sharing Music:</strong> Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.</li><li><strong>Keep The Video Short:</strong> Make sure your video is short because if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music, Instagram’s detection system will limit your content.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:</strong> If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music to it from its built-in music library.</li></ul><h3 id="1-How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram"><a href="#1-How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(1) How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram"></a>(1) How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram</h3><p>There are several workarounds for using <strong>copyrighted music on Instagram:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborating With Artists Or Musicians:</strong> Reach out to local musicians or new artists to see if you can collaborate and create custom sounds for your Instagram videos.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Achieving-Seamless-Sounds-Logic-X-Crossfade-Guide"><a href="#Achieving-Seamless-Sounds-Logic-X-Crossfade-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Achieving Seamless Sounds: Logic X Crossfade Guide"></a>Achieving Seamless Sounds: Logic X Crossfade Guide</h2><p>Being a top-notch editor, you’d anticipate the cross-fade Logic Pro to perform at its highest level as Logic has added more and more features. Music industry experts may create and edit dynamic audio tracks utilizing step-sequencing, multi-device editing, and live looping features with the help of the Logic Pro crossfades and full audio editing features it offers. Modern synthesizers, retro gear, and intricate multi-sampled instruments are just a few of the plugins and sounds that are included with Logic Pro X.</p><p>One of Apple’s hidden crown jewels for a number of years now has been the music creation program Logic Pro X. Logic Pro keeps becoming better and better. Fades make it easier to segue between different parts of a composition or between different track components. Audio and MIDI zones in the workspace may be faded in or out in a number of ways in Logic Pro X. Find out the detailed steps to Logic Pro crossfade in the upcoming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Logic-Pro-X"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Logic-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Crossfade Audio in Logic Pro X"></a>Part 1. Steps to Crossfade Audio in Logic Pro X</h2><p>Users of any iOS device may control audio filters, mix multiple tracks, and play built-in software instruments using the Logic Remote feature. The fastest method to do a fade in or fade out is to use the fade tool on a loop, sample, recording, or whole track. The fade tool can currently only be used with audio regions, however utilizing this technique, a fade may be swiftly created in only a few seconds.</p><h5 id="Step1-Create-two-tracks"><a href="#Step1-Create-two-tracks" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create two tracks"></a>Step1 Create two tracks</h5><p>Your audio files should be imported into two new stereo Audio Tracks that you create in the Arrange section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-two-tracks-logic-prox.jpg"                      alt="create two tracks logic prox"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Connect-Two-Audio-Regions"><a href="#Step2-Connect-Two-Audio-Regions" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Connect Two Audio Regions"></a>Step2 Connect Two Audio Regions</h5><p>On the grid, place two audio areas next to one another. Crossfading may be used with two entirely different audio regions or a duplication of a single audio region.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/connect-two-audio-regions-prox.jpg"                      alt="connect two audio regions prox"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Choose-the-Fade-Tool"><a href="#Step3-Choose-the-Fade-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Choose the Fade Tool"></a>Step3 Choose the Fade Tool</h5><p>You will choose every region on a track when you browse to it in the track header section. If the music contains numerous regions, you should choose the first area to deal with as executing a cross-fade requires you to first pick the regions you’d want to have the fade effect. Select the Fade Tool from the drop-down option for the Left-Click Tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/change-fade-tool-logic-prox.jpg"                      alt="change fade tool logic prox"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Create-a-crossfade"><a href="#Step4-Create-a-crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Create a crossfade"></a>Step4 Create a crossfade</h5><p>Although it works as intended, moving the volume fader on one of the channel strips to switch between two recordings is not really enjoyable. Let’s make the crossfader larger.</p><p><strong>New &gt; Horizontal 4; Fader</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-crossfade-logic-prox.jpg"                      alt="create crossfade logic prox"                ></p><p>You now have total discretion over the fader’s look. Changing it afterwards is always an option; just choose the appropriate Style in the Inspector.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Crossfade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Crossfade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Alternative Way to Crossfade Audio"></a>Part 2. Alternative Way to Crossfade Audio</h2><p>Once adjusted, you may listen to your music library in a new manner; but, with Logic Pro X, it’s rather a laborious effort to do so. This audio mixing approach instantly improves the way your music collection is played seem more professional and makes listening to it more enjoyable. So, to crossfade Logic recordings, we advise utilizing <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. At a fraction of the price of powerful digital audio workstations like Pro Tools, Filmora delivers virtually all the functionality and versatility, if not the usability or aesthetic appeal.</p><p>It’s difficult to go wrong with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> whether you’re seeking to start podcasting or recording music.

You can make it brighter or dull by moving the brightness bar to either the left or the right. Other adjustments are the contrast, saturation, and white balance.</p><p><strong>Choose your photos from the gallery:</strong> you don’t have to search for your data from other platforms. Simply choose photos or videos to use from the gallery. This applies to the earlier saved photos. However, you can also use your camera to shoot instant photos.</p><p><strong>Color correction:</strong> your image color could be too bright or dull. This feature enables you to correct the color to a perfect tone. Besides, you get to choose from a wide range of colors, or better still, do a quick mix even as you correct the needed sections.</p><p>You don’t intend to compose your video and miss an open platform to share your content.

It is powerful, with enough tools to carry out a couple of color grading effects.</p><h4 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h4><p>The 3D LUT Creator has a working image and a reference image. These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance.

These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.</p><p>To download the app, visit the official website of 3D LUT Creator at:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://3dlutcreator.com/" >http://3dlutcreator.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Concluding-Remarks-3"><a href="#Concluding-Remarks-3" class="headerlink" title="Concluding Remarks"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with <strong>the 3D LUT Creator</strong> is quite interesting.
