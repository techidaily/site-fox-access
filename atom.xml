If yes, there is no need to worry because we are here to answer your question and guide you completely about it.</p><h3 id="Import-1"><a href="#Import-1" class="headerlink" title="Import"></a>Import</h3><p>Let’s discuss how you can import your videos. So, first of all, you have to grant the VivaCut video editor permission to access your media gallery. Then you can import the videos as much as you want. However, there are a few limitations regarding it if you are using the free version: you can only export videos for up to five minutes.</p><h3 id="Primary-Editing-1"><a href="#Primary-Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="Primary Editing"></a>Primary Editing</h3><p>So now, let’s move forward using primary or essential editing tools in your videos. As we discussed earlier, you can use almost all the essential editing tools, whether using a free or a premium version. You can quickly get all these tools at the bottom of your mobile’s screen. However, some features that need opening through the Canvas menu will not show. You can use these features in your videos by just clicking on them.</p><h3 id="Filters-and-AI-effects-1"><a href="#Filters-and-AI-effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Filters and AI effects"></a>Filters and AI effects</h3><p>We will discuss how we can apply filters and AI effects to our videos using VivaCut. To use them in your videos, first of all, you have to click on the specific video on which you want to use them from the timeline. A menu will appear at the bottom of your mobile’s screen from which you can click on the filters or AI effects option, whatever you want to use. In the free version, you have only access to the limited filters, and AI effects are not available. It would be best to upgrade your plan to get unlimited access to the AI effects and filter library.</p><h3 id="Chroma-Key-1"><a href="#Chroma-Key-1" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Key"></a>Chroma Key</h3><p>Chroma Key is another excellent feature in the VivaCut video editor, which you can use to change your video’s background easily. To use this feature in your videos, you must click on the video layer and select the Chroma key option from the menu at the bottom. You can also set up its settings according to your requirements from the menu. Also, this feature is available in both (free and premium) versions.</p><h3 id="Export-1"><a href="#Export-1" class="headerlink" title="Export"></a>Export</h3><p>Now at the end, we will discuss how we can export our edited videos from it. So we can do this by clicking on the Export button at the top right corner of our screen. In the next step, it will ask us in which quality we want to export our video. Now it’s upon us whether we export it in 720p (HD) or 480p (SD). We can also export our videos in 1080p (FHD), but for this, we have to purchase the premium package of it. Also, as we discussed earlier, we need a premium version to export videos longer than five minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/vivacut-video-editor-review-2.jpg"                      alt="click on export button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094476/7443" target="_top" id="2094476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-the-VivaCut-Video-Editor-App-1"><a href="#Part-4-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-the-VivaCut-Video-Editor-App-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The audio in the chosen portion will progressively get quieter when the fade out effect is applied, ending in stillness. The fade out tool is nearly totally automated, making it simple and understandable for both novices and experts.

But, from a wide plethora of choices available on the internet to download for video editing, you could be confused regarding which one would be the best for you. That is why here in this article, we will talk about <strong>final-cut pro-plug-ins</strong> that can be downloaded from the internet free of cost or by paying.</p><p>If you are not aware of what plug-ins for final cut pro are. Then, let us take a brief look at them: - Third-party add-ons, called plug-ins, are tools used to enhance videos in final cut pro X. They can add new features to your final cut pro software that original developers didn’t include. Most plug-ins are created by ordinary people to enhance their work and are sometimes shared on the internet for free or at a fee.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Fx factory pro</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">mLUT</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Color Finale 2.0</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">NewBlueFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Movie Pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Free XEffects Matrix Plugin</a></li><li><a href="#part1-7">Motion blur plug-in</a></li><li><a href="#part1-8">Free data pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-9">Distortion effects</a></li><li><a href="#part1-10">Shutter shock FCPX plug-in</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Part 2.

Fx factory pro</h3><p>Fx factory pro is one of the <strong>best final cut pro plug ins</strong> that users can try for free to access if the plug-in is suited to their video editing work. But while using the trials, fx factory pro would watermark the video, although, after purchase, it gets removed. Users can easily download it from the Fx factory website, and its smooth layout will help you quickly navigate its homepage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/fx-factory-pro.jpg"                      alt="fx factory pro"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about fx factory pro integration with <strong>fcpx plug-ins</strong>, you need not worry about that because the coordination between the two is off-charts. Many professionals looking for video editing websites consider Fx factory as their ideal destination for choosing plug-ins for their work.</p><h3 id="2-mLUT"><a href="#2-mLUT" class="headerlink" title="2. mLUT"></a>2. mLUT</h3><p>Are you not satisfied with final cut pro X color grading software even though you don’t necessarily hate it but want to see improvements in it? That’s where the mLUT plug-in of motion VFX comes into the picture. Ideally, it is a free plug-in that video editors can use to look up their tables in one place together. One of the eye-catching features of mLUT from Motion VFX would ask your video to be shot in a longer format to get the best out of your color grading capabilities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/mlut-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="mlut plug in"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938682/19272" target="_top" id="1938682">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938682" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938682/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you want to add more to your video editing, the paid version of mLUT packs offered by Motion VFX will allow you to add a cinematic look to your video efficiently. After all this, you find your video or image not perfect, so make sure you keep using it.</p><h3 id="3-Color-Finale-2-0"><a href="#3-Color-Finale-2-0" class="headerlink" title="3. Color Finale 2.0"></a>3. Color Finale 2.0</h3><p>Most people using final cut pro X were somewhat unsatisfied with the internally practical fast color correction tools. It was always about having something that properly allowed video color grading workflow. That is when color finale 2.0, a newer version of the initially released color finale, is known to come in handy. It is a new and more improved version of the previous one, which is optimized for having metal and more color management features such as ACES.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/color-finale-2-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="color finale 2 plug in"                ></p><p>From the beginning, the color finale was designed as a plug-in for the final cut pro-X. It offers the users two options: go for the standard one or pro to enjoy more features like tangent panel control, group grading, ACES color space, film grain simulation, and mask tracking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948881/19272" target="_top" id="1948881">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948881" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948881/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-NewBlueFX"><a href="#4-NewBlueFX" class="headerlink" title="4. NewBlueFX"></a>4. NewBlueFX</h3><p>Suppose you are looking for a compatible video editing program like adobe after effects, premiere pro, and some other software like it. Then, a new blue FX that provides an alternative to critical aspects like framing, masking, and offering necessary plug-ins to improve the videos and eliminate other challenges could be the choice for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/new-blue-fx-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="new blue fx plug in"                ></p><p>There are many plug-ins offered in New blue fx, and each has features that push forward for its improvement every day. The zoom effects or auto-pan plug-in could be your solution when adding some still motion or picture into your video. It identifies the significant highs and lows of the video or image, changes the detail, and contrasts automatically whenever or wherever needed.</p><h3 id="5-Movie-Pop"><a href="#5-Movie-Pop" class="headerlink" title="5. Movie Pop"></a>5. Movie Pop</h3><p>Do you consider you’re a crazy fan of movies, and being a video creator, you are always on the move on how to recreate those famous movie sequences that you watched in movie halls or on your computer? Then, the movie could be the perfect plug-in, ideally serving this kind of situation. It is considered the easiest to recreate those title sequences of the favorite movies you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/movie-pop-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="movie pop plug in"                ></p><p>If you want something more out of these <strong>final cut plug</strong>-<strong>ins</strong>, add your recreation of the title. Then, unfortunately, it won’t be able to offer you those because movie pop developed by stupid raisins was made for the above work only and nothing more. It is a free plug-in that editors can download from the internet.</p><h3 id="6-Free-XEffects-Matrix-Plugin"><a href="#6-Free-XEffects-Matrix-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="6. Free XEffects Matrix Plugin"></a>6. Free XEffects Matrix Plugin</h3><p>If you are a big fan of the matrix trilogy and want to add a specific green cascading effect into your video, then the free X effects matrix plug-in will offer you that. Instead, searching from numerous plug-ins available on the internet for adding this special effect matrix plug-in will ensure the work is done for you as per your need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/free-xeffects-matrix-plugin.jpg"                      alt="free xeffects matrix plugin"                ></p><p>It would specifically save a lot of time and energy for you that can be used for some other purposes that are in more of its need. The process is also quite simple:</p><ul><li>Entering the main title text</li><li>Adjusting the color density according to your specification</li><li>The text’s speed and ideal position</li></ul><p>After completing these above steps, your plug-in will be built automatically.</p><h3 id="7-Motion-blur-plug-in"><a href="#7-Motion-blur-plug-in" class="headerlink" title="7. Motion blur plug-in"></a>7. Motion blur plug-in</h3><p>The motion blur plug-in is free and can easily download from the internet as per your choice. If you want to add motion blur to your motion graphic or some subject in the film, no other plug-in was made for this situation than motion blur plug-in. After downloading, you may notice the plug taking some time to settle your final cut pro X, so keep close to its working through effective monitoring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/motion-blur-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="motion blur plug in"                ></p><p>This motion blur plug-in is considered perfect for adding time-lapses, quick-moving graphics, and a certain chaotic feeling to your movie or a specific shot in your video through some slick editing.

Free data pop"></a>8. Free data pop</h3><p>Free data pop plug-in could be perfect if your video needs some specific editing that involves adding varying levels of charts and graphs into the shots. Data pop is said to have 22 customizable professional quality free final cut pro X graphic styles or designs from which you can choose one according to your requirement. Moreover, this mainly includes different types of charts, graphs, and pie charts on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/free-data-pop-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="free data pop plug in"                ></p><p>Let the data speak for itself; if you are looking for this kind of tone in your movie or video scene, free data pop will help you achieve that.

Distortion effects"></a>9. Distortion effects</h3><p>Do you want to add some classic distortion effects to the video or musical? For that distortion effect, plug-ins in your final cut pro X could be the ideal solution. There are four unique effects that you can choose to add to your final cut pro X and modify upon it through some adjusting of its parameters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/distortion-effects-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="distortion effects plug in"                ></p><p>The black hole feature offered would drag your video image to a single location or point, and the Bulge feature would add an inward or outward bulge to the image. Next would be the circular zig-zag, a ripple-type effect that doubles the amount of refraction on the image. And lastly, the twirl effect twists your clip to a certain degree to move it from subtle to extreme points.</p><h3 id="10-Shutter-shock-FCPX-plug-in"><a href="#10-Shutter-shock-FCPX-plug-in" class="headerlink" title="10. Shutter shock FCPX plug-in"></a>10. Shutter shock FCPX plug-in</h3><p>Finally, the last one on our list is the shutter shock FCPX plug-in, which needed to be included, or the list would be considered incomplete for starters.

The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1. B roll In TV And Movies"></a>1. B roll In TV And Movies</h2><p>Broll is an acronym for “background” or “behind,” respectively. It usually refers to extra footage captured with a movie camera while keeping the lighting consistent between scenes in the movie industry. When the filmmaker doesn’t want to show any dialogue or action on screen but needs some movement within the frame, it might be utilized as filler.</p><p>B roll has been used from the first silent movies, including D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film “Intolerance.” Griffith’s creative application All of the shots that are used in a movie or television show are collectively referred to as “b roll footage.” To add context and complexity to the production being recorded, these shots are frequently seen on screen in quick succession.</p><p>B roll can be utilized for establishing shots as well as close-ups of items. It is used by filmmakers when they lack the funds for pricey films or when they want to showcase their originality. It’s also a fantastic method for narrating stories devoid of conversation. It might be anything, such a view of a landscape or a person’s hands holding up a sign with words on it.</p><p>For instance, wider shots are frequently used when someone is giving a speech while seated behind a podium so that we can see both them and their surroundings, such as audience members standing close and applauding or security personnel.</p><h2 id="2-Methods-to-use-b-roll"><a href="#2-Methods-to-use-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="2.

It can also be used to set the mood for an event or show what time of day it is when filming.</p><p>The ideal way to use B roll is to put it behind interviews. This kind of footage can be used in three ways: as establishing shots, cutaways, and transitions. Most of the time, the first few minutes of an interview or video help set the scene with “establishing shots.”</p><p>On the other hand, cutaways can show how different people react to what is being said in an interview. After all, transitions are commonly used to switch from one person’s experience with a certain topic to another person’s experience with the same topic. All of these different kinds of footage give filmmakers and videographers more freedom to tell their stories without relying too much on dialogue or narration.</p><h2 id="3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3.

These photos happen a while after the sets have been taken down, clothes and props stowed, and the actors and crew have gone on to new projects.</p><p>If flaws were discovered during primary photography, the directors could have requested another take. The producer and director should weigh the cost of rejoining cast and crew against the need for pick-ups or re-shoots to address storyline flaws (or worse) in the final edit.</p><h3 id="7-A-roll-vs-b-roll"><a href="#7-A-roll-vs-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="7.

Everything else on your editing table must be rearranged to fit it. When the speaker in the following video is directly talking to the camera or interviewer, this is A roll footage.

Once the photo is uploaded, it will automatically detect human figures and will remove its background. You can then add any other background of your choice – texture, bold colors, customized images, and so on. If you want, you can freely download the image for 0.25 megapixels, but to download an HD image, you have to pay one credit per photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-removebg.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer removebg"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770526">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770526">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770526%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770526/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#3-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="3. Adobe Spark"></a>3. Adobe Spark</h4><p>If you are looking for a hassle-free solution to change a photo’s background, then you can also try Adobe Spark. The online tool is powered by Adobe and will let you upload any JPG or PNG photos. Afterward, the application will remove the background of the image and will let you save it as a PNG file that you can overlap on any background of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-spark.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer spark"                ></p><h4 id="4-Wondershare-PixCut"><a href="#4-Wondershare-PixCut" class="headerlink" title="4.

The tool supports PNG and JPG files and would let you automatically remove the background of an image. Its AI features can automatically detect all the popular figures like human faces, cars, trees, pets, and so on. However, using Slazzer, you can only remove the background of an image and would have to insert a new background on another tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-slazzer.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer slazzer"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer"><a href="#6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6. Fotor Photo Background Changer"></a>6. Fotor Photo Background Changer</h4><p>Fotor offers a couple of online features related to photo editing and this one is another smart tool that you can use on its website. The image background changer is easy to use, can remove the background of any photo, and let you replace it with a new one. While it offers some of the most advanced features for online image editing, the application is not available for free (and would cost around $8.99 per month).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-fotor.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer fotor"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151866/7443" target="_top" id="2151866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover"></a>7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Clip Magic also offers a smart and quick solution to change the background of an image online. Once the photo is loaded to the online application, it will let you get rid of the background easily (without any technical hassle). Apart from that, you can also use its smart editor to make all kinds of minor changes to your photos easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-clip-magic.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer clip magic"                ></p><h4 id="8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover"><a href="#8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover"></a>8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover</h4><p>As the name suggests, this is a freely available image editor that can also be used to change a photo’s background. Since it is an online tool, you can use it on any website without downloading anything on your system. Once the photo is manually uploaded, the application will automatically detect a figure (like a human face, car, or any other object). It will now crop the area of the figure and would remove its background, letting you change it later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-edit-photos.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer edit photos"                ></p><h4 id="9-Foco-Clipping"><a href="#9-Foco-Clipping" class="headerlink" title="9. Foco Clipping"></a>9. Foco Clipping</h4><p>The next perfect photo background changer that I would recommend is from Foco Clipping. One of the best things about this online tool is that it can remove the background of multiple images at the same time. You can upload your photos in a bulk, let it process them, and remove their background. The image background changer is known for its exceptional results for cropping human figures with precise body and hair scaling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-foco.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer foco"                ></p><h4 id="10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer"><a href="#10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="10.PicsArt Image Background Changer"></a>10.PicsArt Image Background Changer</h4><p>The online photo background changer by PicsArt is quite easy to use and offers a wide range of features.

And it supports 4K real-time video transmission from up to 2 km away. It has almost compacted every sensor in Phantom 4 inside Mavic Pro. It is an excellent choice for small unmanned aerial vehicles (From 24th May, the best choice is DJI Spark). However, the public has not officially seen an accessory that was revealed in the conference. This is DJI Goggles – a first person perspective FPV flying glasses that has resolution comparable to VR glasses.

What is Head Tracking"></a>#1. What is Head Tracking</h6><p> Like remote controller sticks, you can now use head movements to control both aircraft yaw and camera tilt in Head Tracking Flight mode. You can simply control turn left or right to yaw left or right, and straighten your head to stop turning. In Head Tracking Gimbal mode, you will not affect the jaw as only the gimbal will move.</p><h6 id="2-Experience-Fun-but-not-very-practical"><a href="#2-Experience-Fun-but-not-very-practical" class="headerlink" title="#2. Experience: Fun but not very practical"></a>#2. Experience: Fun but not very practical</h6><p> In the past, an unmanned drone is always separated by a mobile phone no matter how high the resolution of the graphic is. Now, you can have the image transmission directly displayed in your eyes. Through head tracking, you can achieve a similar effect to that of VR. It is very interesting.</p><p> But, in my opinion, these head tracking remains in a stage where it is only for playing once in a while, it is unlikely to be used in photo shooting mission for the long term. Here are the reasons:</p><ul><li>Frame rate is slightly lower, there are delays</li></ul><p> Mavic’s OcuSync image transmission works perfect on iPad, but it indeed caused dizziness on DJI Goggles.</p><p> To reduce the effect of dizziness, the ideal number of frames rate of Goggles is 120fps. PSVR’s 90 fps had caused a lot of complaints. But, with DJI Goggles, this number is lowered to the lowest 30fps. With 110s image transmission delay, any head rotation at any point will make anyone feel dizzy.</p><ul><li>Too sensitive</li></ul><p> The mission of 3-axis gimbal is to remove any camera shakes and stabilize the footage. But, the DJI Goggles’ head tracking actually bring back these shakes which do not come from the camera itself, but as a result of the commands of head tracking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123732/7443" target="_top" id="2123732">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123732" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123732/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tapfly"><a href="#Tapfly" class="headerlink" title="Tapfly"></a>Tapfly</h3><h6 id="1-What-is-Tapfly"><a href="#1-What-is-Tapfly" class="headerlink" title="#1.

This makes navigating the internal menu system simple and intuitive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggles-touchpad.gif"                      alt="DJI Goggle&#39;s touchpad"                ></p><p> Image resource: <a class="link"   href="https://store.dji.com/guides/dji-goggles-unboxing-and-quick-review/" >DJI Official Site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h6 id="2-Experience"><a href="#2-Experience" class="headerlink" title="#2. Experience"></a>#2. Experience</h6><p> DJI Goggles’s main interaction needs to be done through the touchpad. This touchpad supports swipe and clicks of single and double fingers.

If you wanted to be involved in very high-level camera work, then you would need some fancier gear, but for most people’s purposes, what they have on their phone is just fine. This article is aimed at looking at how people can use their iPhone to record good quality videos which they can enjoy with their friends.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Use-Stabilizers"><a href="#Use-Stabilizers" class="headerlink" title="Use Stabilizers"></a>Use Stabilizers</h2><p> Many people are critical of the ‘found footage’ types of movies which are sometimes released – the Blair Witch project being a prime example. This is generally because the shaky videography can make it difficult to really follow what is going on, or possibly also because it is hard to watch without feeling ill.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/stabilizer.jpg"                      alt="stabilizer"                ></p><p> This same complaint is often used in iPhone videography – it is difficult to follow because the video is shaking. The shaking is what happens when the video lacks stability – remember that most professional camera work is done with cameras which are on some form of frame or tripod to keep the camera still. It isn’t that an iPhone is heavy – it is more to do with the video being hard to keep still, especially if our attention is distracted. For the best videos, people should invest in some form of tripod for their phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043661/7443" target="_top" id="2043661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043661/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-Light-Properly"><a href="#Use-Light-Properly" class="headerlink" title="Use Light Properly"></a>Use Light Properly</h2><p> Professional video shoots use a lot of light in order to create the proper effect – most people would be surprised to learn how much light goes into even a ‘night-time’ set. Phone videos often suffer a lot because they do not make adequate use of light. Part of this can be solved by taking a camera class which covers light issues, but it can also be solved by paying attention to light sources where you are, and changing them to better suit your video if possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/set-light-iphone.jpg"                      alt="light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Avoid-Using-the-Digital-Zoom"><a href="#Avoid-Using-the-Digital-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Using the Digital Zoom"></a>Avoid Using the Digital Zoom</h2><p> It can be very tempting to try and use the zoom function on your camera to see people better, but this ultimately doesn’t work. You will end up with a grainy video of uncertain quality, rather than one which allows you to see everything in close up. Just move towards the point you are attempting to film – the quality of the video will be better, and you will not have to fiddle with controls and menus while making the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/Zoom.jpg"                      alt="zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Use-the-Grid"><a href="#Use-the-Grid" class="headerlink" title="Use the Grid"></a>Use the Grid</h2><p> Pictures and videos can be taken in either portrait or landscape format, as everybody who has tried to take a picture knows. When recording a video, you should use this to your advantage and try and find which grid would be the most effective for your video. Using the grids is very easy - simply tip the iPhone in the direction you want to film, and the film will automatically work in that format. Since it can be very easy for a phone to change grids while videoing, this is another opportunity for a stabiliser such as a tripod to be put into use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/grid-iphone-camera.png"                      alt="grid"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982462">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982462%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982462/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-the-Exposure-Lock"><a href="#Use-the-Exposure-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Use the Exposure Lock"></a>Use the Exposure Lock</h2><p> When taking a video or a picture, you will have noticed that it can change the colour and the exposure while trying to get a lock and fix on what it is going to be recording. While it is good that it tries to find the best way to accommodate the light and sound in the room, having your video change exposure throughout will be at best annoying and at worst an outright distraction. Lock your exposure down on the iPhone once you have found the optimum conditions for the video, and it will not change.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/lock-exposure.jpg"                      alt="exposure"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136622/26400" target="_top" id="2136622">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136622" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136622/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-Slow-Motion-Time-Lapse-Mode"><a href="#Use-Slow-Motion-Time-Lapse-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Use Slow Motion\Time Lapse Mode"></a>Use Slow Motion\Time Lapse Mode</h2><p> One way to make videos more interesting is to use either slow motion or time lapse features. The well-known use of time lapse video is if the video is extremely long, and it needs to be shortened – we are all aware of the use of montages in films, after all – and it can be very effective when used correctly. Slow motion is different - it can be used for the same reasons as in films, but it can also be used for when you need to follow instructions, or for when you want to follow what is being done in absolute detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/time-lapse-iphone.jpg"                      alt="time lapse"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938750/19272" target="_top" id="1938750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938750/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Put-your-iPhone-in-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Put-your-iPhone-in-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your iPhone in Airplane Mode"></a>Put your iPhone in Airplane Mode</h2><p> There is nothing worse than being in the middle of recording a great video, and then being interrupted by a notification. Even worse, since phones vibrate when they receive a notification, and it will ruin the entire video if that happens, since the phone will move and throw off the exposure and the light enhancements which you have been using.</p><p> Putting your phone in airplane mode allows you to stop any notifications from coming in at all, and thus keeping them from ruining your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode"                ></p><h2 id="Edit-your-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-your-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit your Video with Filmora"></a>Edit your Video with Filmora</h2><p> Films go through extensive editing processes before being released to the general public, so why shouldn’t you edit your videos? Things go wrong in the process of making a video – somebody appears where they shouldn’t, a phone rings, people have conversations, the tripod falls down, the camera ends up pointed the wrong way….a lot can happen. Editing your video means that you can take all these problems out, and also means that you can tighten up the video generally, improve the sound quality, and make sure that everything is as it should be before you show it off.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Using your iPhone to make a video is not something which requires a lot of extra equipment – it simply requires some planning on your part, as well as knowledge of your iPhone’s systems. Being able to control the grid for the videos, the exposure, and anything else which can be controlled through the iPhone systems makes for much better videos off the bat, while adding in video editing software and tripods can improve the experience even more.

Please note that you will need an iPhone <strong>running with iOS 7 and later.</strong>  Read along to get the steps and fix red eye with iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – tap on the “Photos” app in your iPhone. Post launching the app, look for the layered rectangles icon located at the bottom right corner of the screen. This icon is for “Albums”. Tap on it and proceed to the next step.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Now, tap on “All Photos” appearing on the screen followed by choosing the image you wish to edit.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Choose the “Edit” option from the screen and then you are required to tap on the “Red Eye Correction” option. This eye correction icon will be the image of an eye from which a slanting line is crossing through it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-eye-correction-button-iphone.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image resource: OS X Daily</p><p>Note: The “Red Eye Correction” option will not appear when the picture is captured without the use of flash. It will only be visible on the photos taken with flash and the screenshots.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong> – After this, tap the red eye one by one and the red eye correction feature will change pixels as needed on the tapped area. You can tap eye once again if the edit was not of your preference.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong> – lastly, tap on the eye with slash icon i.e. “Red Eye Correction” icon to return to the main edit screen. Hit on “Done” once satisfied with the results.</p><p>If in case, you feel the changes are not according to what you needed, you can again go to the edit screen and hit on “Revert” option. This will restore the original picture.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148639/16836" target="_top" id="2148639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148639/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-5-Red-eye-remover-apps-for-iPhone"><a href="#Best-5-Red-eye-remover-apps-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Red eye remover apps for iPhone"></a>Best 5 Red eye remover apps for iPhone</h2><p>After making you aware with the tutorial to remove red eye with iPhone Photos app, here are 5 red eye remover apps that will help you for the same.</p><h3 id="1-Adobe-Photoshop-Express"><a href="#1-Adobe-Photoshop-Express" class="headerlink" title="1.

The real environment can be totally replaced with the sounds and sights giving you the feel as though you are actually present in the digital world and part of it.</p><ul><li>Features</li></ul><p> To enhance the experience and make virtual reality exciting headsets and cameras are often used to block out the real world. It’s a totally immersive experience allowing you to interact with a totally different world.</p><ul><li>Platform</li></ul><p> VR has already been used to help with training medical staff and military as well as in gaming to give an experience on a totally different level. More recently virtual reality has stepped up to the next level offering users a more realistic experience to lose themselves in.</p><ul><li>Headset</li></ul><p> By using a headset people are able to walk around their own surroundings yet feel as though they are in a totally different place to their reality. They can interact with other users in games and digital characters without the outside world interrupting.</p><ul><li>Prospect</li></ul><p> Flight and scenario simulation has already been able to utilize virtual reality as a tool for training without actually having to be in a real life situation. In the gaming world it takes people out of their real world and gives them a totally different experience. 360 degree videos have often been confused with virtual reality however because there is no interaction and the scenario has been prerecorded it is not thought to be in the same category. Although virtual reality has been around a long time it is still a great way to escape from the real world altogether and be totally immersed in another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-reality.jpg"                      alt="virtual-reality"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137213/26400" target="_top" id="2137213">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137213" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137213/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="About-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#About-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="About Augmented Reality"></a>About Augmented Reality</h2><ul><li>Features</li></ul><p> AR stands for augmented reality which is a way that you can get an indirect view of a real life scenario or environment in a supplemented way by use of digital technology. A great example of this would be being an empty room yet being able to use digital technology to see how it would look in a different color with different furnishings before actually purchasing them. Sound graphics and other sensory input can help to make the experience more realistic.</p><ul><li>Platform</li></ul><p> Although the digital and other augmented parts of the augmented reality are superimposed in real life they are not actually part of it. It can be used to interact with the real world to help make suggestions of improvement such as recipe ideas based on real ingredients laid out before the camera.</p><ul><li>Headset</li></ul><p> A headset is able to enhance the experience further, such as adding characters in a game that are able to talk and make suggestions, immersing you in part to give you the feel of realism. Augmented reality can be best described as a real life overlay rather than a thorough digital and sensory experience that takes you away from it.</p><ul><li>Prospect</li></ul><p> We are already seeing augmented reality being used to day in real life situations such as training. It is also being used in gaming and more recently with mobile technology using GPS signals to add more realism and accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/augmented-reality.jpg"                      alt="augmented-reality"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141684/17092" target="_top" id="2141684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141684/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139563/4704" target="_top" id="2139563">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139563" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139563/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="About-MR"><a href="#About-MR" class="headerlink" title="About MR"></a>About MR</h2><ul><li>Features</li></ul><p> MR stands for mixed reality which brings the digital world and real world together to bring you a totally new experience. Rather than just being added to the real world the experiences instead are interactive to a point where they can be used in many applications. Characters and scenarios can be mixed real world surroundings.</p><ul><li>Platform</li></ul><p> Mixed reality allows you to get a better sense of realism as the digital scenarios take place in the real world surroundings. This can be used in training and in gaming technology.</p><ul><li>Headset</li></ul><p> Using a headset allows for a better sense of realism, however it as it is a mixed reality not all scenarios would be suitable for headset use if you still wish to interact with others who are physically present. It can however allow other people using the mixed reality to interact on a shared level.</p><ul><li>Prospect</li></ul><p> Holograms have been used more recently to make the user feel as though an object or character is actually there. Synthetic content is being improved all of the time, which shows that the future of mixed reality is not as far away as we may think.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Canvas-of-Colors-Advanced-Theory-Use"><a href="#A-Canvas-of-Colors-Advanced-Theory-Use" class="headerlink" title="A Canvas of Colors: Advanced Theory &amp; Use"></a>A Canvas of Colors: Advanced Theory &amp; Use</h2><p>So, you’ve heard about color theory but don’t know what it is or how to use it and you may also be wondering what color theory could possibly have to do with you. We are talking about the theory of all color combinations and how they can be altered or selected to better work together creating a more pleasant viewing for your audience.</p><p>If you are more selective with your colors in your videos or imagery the viewer will find this aesthetically pleasing and may be more engaged in your content. This includes anything from logo design all the way to props for your shot. When creating your videos within Filmora it is good practice to think about your composition in all aspects including color theory and with the guide hopefully you will have a better understanding of how you can influence your color palette.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Color-Theory"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Theory" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Theory"></a>What Is Color Theory</h2><p>Color theory consists of many elements that could fill a library on its own but for this guide we will focus on two key elements. The color wheel and color harmony. By understanding the color wheel and color harmony you can hand pick which colors to add or use in your pieces to create a well-balanced viewing experience which can help in viewer engagement and enjoyment.</p><p>There are many color wheels out there and all require understanding and research into that particular color arrangement but for this guide I will be focusing on the more widely used RGB which derives from the primary colors red green and blue, If you’re thinking why red green and blue not red yellow and blue then you are observant, while RYB is taught as the three primary colors we will be using what is known as additive primary colors of light meaning the more you add of these colors the closer to white you get, the reason we will be using this combination is due to the fact RYB misses a lot of hues around the violet area and the blue-greens meaning we achieve a higher range of color to pick from. With this in mind let’s start.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144310/7443" target="_top" id="2144310">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144310" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144310/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Color-Wheel"><a href="#The-Color-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="The Color Wheel"></a>The Color Wheel</h2><p>Using red, green and blue as primary colors we can mix the colors to one another to get our secondary colors giving us yellow, magenta and cyan. We can mix these to one another to create our tertiary colors which are raspberry, orange, sprig green, turquoise, ocean and violet giving us something which looks like this</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/color-wheel.jpg"                      alt="colcor wheel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>As you can see, we have every color available in this wheel and they are arranged in a unison with the mixed colors starting with red, green and blue and working towards each other.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049370/7443" target="_top" id="2049370">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049370" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049370/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Color-Harmony"><a href="#Color-Harmony" class="headerlink" title="Color Harmony"></a>Color Harmony</h2><p>So now we know how the wheel is made and what it looks like. What does it do? We can use this wheel now to gather our palette. Within color theory we talk about harmonious colors that work together in a pleasant way creating less stress on the eyes to find information in your scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-harmony.jpg"                      alt="color harmony"                ></p><p>One such harmony is complementary colors and luckily for us this is very easy to find. You take your base color and find the opposite color on the wheel. In this example the complementary color to blue is yellow depicted with a red line.</p><p>These colors always work as they create contrast and stability.</p><p>The blue lines represent what is known as split contrasting colors and these will create balance with each other.</p><p>The corners of the black rectangle land on what is known as tetradic complement and allows you to add four colors with the understanding that they will complement each other perfectly. Lastly is the purple line which represents the analogous complementary colors, you can pick these neighboring colors with the peace of mind that they will harmonize with each other. There are many more but these four are the main ones that you will use more often than any other, by selecting colors using these four main types you can create a palette for your scenes and allow the viewer to effortlessly enjoy your content. These types work no matter where you start from on the wheel so long as you keep the distances the same.</p><h2 id="But-How-Do-I-Use-This"><a href="#But-How-Do-I-Use-This" class="headerlink" title="But How Do I Use This"></a>But How Do I Use This</h2><p>You may still be unsure as to how to implement color theory into your videos. Let’s look at some scenarios that color theory may help your creations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-theory-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color theory video"                ></p><p>In this scene the director decided that the backdrop should complement the top the actor is wearing, looking at our wheel we can see the complementary color would be dark purple so they started with that, to create a more dynamic scene they then used the analogous colors of that purple being pink and red and created the backdrop. This creates a harmony within the scene and makes it effortless to see all the key elements straight away.</p><p>As you can see from this example the base color for the scene is a dark blue&#x2F;purple and using the analogous color of pink they created a point of interest within the scene that doesn’t look out of place. This is a very good way to pull the viewers eyes towards something you want them to take in above all else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/movie-cover-with-color-theory.jpg"                      alt="movie cover with color theory"                ></p><p>As you can see from all the movie covers above, they all use complementary colors from the blues to the war yellows and oranges, this creates high contrast and balance and is something done within the movie industry in every scene. It’s no coincidence that the joker is purple and green or that the iron man is red and gold, this is well prepared and researched in the planning stages of everything a visual artist creates.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484910/16446" target="_top" id="1484910">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484910" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484910/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>By including this into your thought process when creating videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will achieve well balanced and harmonious content for your viewer to enjoy and create better engagement.

This app will let you add background music to video on iPhone with the steps given below. Thus, go along the steps to get the method learned.</p><p>Firstly, open the iMovie app on your device and go to the “Project” section which is located at the top screen.</p><p>Next, you need to tap on the “Create Project” which is available as a ‘+’ icon. Afterward, you will notice two panels namely, ‘Movie” and “Trailer”. Choose the former one followed by tapping on the “Create” option.</p><p>When this is done, your project interface will be on the screen. Subsequently, go to the “Media” icon located at the top left corner at the timeline. The videos gallery will appear on the screen. Choose one in which you want to add the music and tap on the “Add” icon. The source video will now add to the timeline of iMovie.</p><p>Scroll the timeline to the initial point of the video in order to add the music at the point.</p><p>Now you can add music by following the same procedure that we did for adding video from the gallery. This will add the music successfully. Please make sure to place the music at background if you want low volume music. The “Background” option will be at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Now, tap the “Play” button to preview the video along with the music. Once satisfied, tap on “Done” placed at the left corner of the screen.</p><p>Tip: If your video’s duration is more than the audio duration, iMovie will automatically loop the background music. Therefore, there is an option to adjust the length of the media file. You can set it according to your preference.

In the following part, I’ll take Filmora for Windows as an example to illustrate <strong>how to add music to iPhone videos.</strong> The steps on Filmora for Mac are similar.</p><p>Step 1 – Import iPhone Videos to Filmora</p><p>Launch Wondershare Filmora and begin with importing the iPhone source video file to Filmora. Choose “Import” and then go to the “Import from a Camera or a Phone” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-from-camera-phone-filmora.jpg"                      alt="import iPhone videos to Filmora"                ></p><p>Tips: if your videos are shot vertically and you want to edit them in the 9:16 aspect ratio, you’ll need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adjust the aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Project settings.</p><p>In the pop-up window, choose the device, preview and check the media that you want to add music to. Those media will be saved in the default folder, and click OK to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-import-from-device.jpg"                      alt="import iPhone videos to Filmora window"                ></p><p>All imported media will be placed in the Project Media Library, you can then drag and drop them to the video track on the timeline.</p><p>Step 2 – Add Music and Sound Effect to Video</p><p>Filmora features an Audio Library which contains royalty-free music tracks and sound effects to choose from. Go for the one you find pleasant and drop it to the Audio track on the timeline. If you want to add your own music, you can simply import the files using the “My music” option on the left toolbar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Audio Library"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1175223/12108" target="_top" id="1175223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1175223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1175223/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3 – Edit Soundtrack</p><p>Prior to the finalization of the video, you can also edit the soundtrack for example; you can speed up the sound or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add fade in&#x2F;out effect. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> You can also start equalizer etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg"                      alt="edit sound in Filmora"                ></p><p>Step 4 – Export the Video File</p><p>When you are done with everything, it’s time to export your creation.

It is a new mode of creating a video as well as making money.</p><p>Based on Twitter, you can now get paid to live stream using Periscope.

Find Out What You Really Want To Live Stream"></a>1. Find Out What You Really Want To Live Stream</h4><p>When you start out with live streaming of videos, it becomes essential to pick the right topic that can attract viewers. You must be able to understand and choose one particular thing you like to be known about.</p><p>Is it the trending games or anything else that people are concentrating more on? You need to find the right subject for your video live streaming in order to make money on Periscope. Once a particular topic is selected, suppose you wish to live stream games, try to analyze which game is the most trending one.</p><p>Try to check out the search engines and other gaming sites to find out the games that are the most in news but not yet, saturated. If you are not sure which topic to choose, you may look into gaming communities and forums to see which game is the most focused one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-to-stream-periscope.JPG"                      alt="stream on periscope"                ></p><h4 id="2-Consistent-Streaming"><a href="#2-Consistent-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="2. Consistent Streaming"></a>2. Consistent Streaming</h4><p>It is essential to maintain a consistent schedule while publishing content. What does that mean? It means that the time span of the live streaming must be consistent in order to keep your audiences informed. If your audiences have to keep waiting and they are not aware of your posting schedule, they might lose interest and focus.</p><p>Suppose you have 3 videos ready and you stream for 3 consecutive days and then disappear for 3 weeks. It gives the wrong message to your audiences. So, it is better to live stream consistently on a weekly basis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Consistent-Streaming.JPG"                      alt="Consistent Streaming."                ></p><h4 id="3-Talk-to-Yourself-if-You-Are-Shy"><a href="#3-Talk-to-Yourself-if-You-Are-Shy" class="headerlink" title="3. Talk to Yourself if You Are Shy"></a>3. Talk to Yourself if You Are Shy</h4><p>Are you a camera-friendly person? If not, then live streaming can be a quite intimidating task for you, especially if you are shy. Facing the camera and seeing and hearing yourself can be awkward if you are not used to it.</p><p>So, try and make it a habit to face the mirror, overlook any flaws that you might be observing, and talk to yourself continuously as much as you can. Increase at least 10-15 seconds with each session of chatting with yourself in the mirror. This will increase your confidence and help you in making yourself comfortable and at ease while you talk.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/talk-periscope.JPG"                      alt="talk periscope."                ></p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Script"><a href="#4-Make-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Script"></a>4. Make a Script</h4><p>Having a hard and fast script and narrating or speaking mugged up lines like a school kid can completely ruin your video. So, try to be spontaneous. Keep the points you wish to include in your video handy and refer to it every now and then to have a clear picture of what you would like to say. But, do not make a video as if someone forced you to speak. Be natural and sporty.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/writer-script-periscope.JPG"                      alt="writer script periscope."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006928/19272" target="_top" id="2006928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Money-On-Periscope-With-Tactics"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Money-On-Periscope-With-Tactics" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Money On Periscope With Tactics"></a>Part 3: How To Make Money On Periscope With Tactics</h2><h4 id="1-Doing-Active-Interaction"><a href="#1-Doing-Active-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="1. Doing Active Interaction"></a>1. Doing Active Interaction</h4><p>If you want to make money on Periscope, it is essential to reach out to your audiences. Apart from the stream chats, you must share all your social handles like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. with all your subscribers.</p><p>Sharing your social media handles does not mean that you have to befriend all your subscribers, but you may share the social page which you want your subscribers to follow, where they may post any query or know more about your live streaming videos. Such active interaction is essential in order to make money from live streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/periscope-interactive.JPG"                      alt="interaction periscope."                ></p><h4 id="2-Find-A-Company-To-Let-Them-Sponsor-You"><a href="#2-Find-A-Company-To-Let-Them-Sponsor-You" class="headerlink" title="2. Find A Company To Let Them Sponsor You"></a>2. Find A Company To Let Them Sponsor You</h4><p>When a company agrees to sponsor your live streaming video, you get paid to live stream. Do you know how? Your followers may not be aware that they are seeing a coffee mug with a company logo, or a service pitch in the background while you are explaining something or talking to your audiences.</p><p>But, you make money on Periscope on a regular basis for just sharing the services or products while streaming live. Getting hooked on the big and right brands and companies can earn you handsomely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sponsor-periscope.JPG"                      alt="sponsor periscope."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049364/7443" target="_top" id="2049364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049364/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Create-Value-for-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Create-Value-for-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Create Value for Your Audience"></a>3. Create Value for Your Audience</h4><p>Never share any below grade and useless videos with your audience. In order to make money from live streaming, ensure valued information and an interesting watch for your viewers. Worthy content and a great presentation can rope in more subscribers and retain the existing ones, in addition to getting paid to live stream.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With the live video content setting the trends, always ensure if you are making one, you must get paid to live stream. Twitter, supporting the Periscope app is a great way to make money from live streaming. Follow the above points and make money on Periscope by sharing great live content which the viewers would love to gain knowledge from and watch glued to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972693/19272" target="_top" id="1972693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972693/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-max-360-and-hero-11-gopro-comparison-which-reigns-supreme-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Max 360 and Hero 11 GoPro Comparison - Which Reigns Supreme, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionize-streaming-top-converters-transform-4k-content-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionize Streaming Top Converters Transform 4K Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/bluetooth-integration-tips-connecting-sound-equipment-to-desktop-systems/"><u>Bluetooth Integration Tips: Connecting Sound Equipment to Desktop Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/fake-android-location-without-rooting-for-your-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>Fake Android Location without Rooting For Your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-amplify-detail-top-tips-for-shooting-up-closer-with-videoleap/"><u>In 2024, Amplify Detail Top Tips for Shooting Up Closer with VideoLeap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/in-2024-reimagine-fuzzy-images-selecting-the-ultimate-10-internet-tools/"><u>In 2024, Reimagine Fuzzy Images Selecting the Ultimate 10 Internet Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-nokia-105-classic-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Nokia 105 Classic | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/"><u>Pattern Locks Are Unsafe Secure Your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Phone Now with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/perfecting-cgi-in-depth-tutorial-for-kinemaster-users/"><u>Perfecting CGI In-Depth Tutorial for Kinemaster Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-steps-how-to-resolve-issues-with-a-non-functional-thaumaturge-app-on-windows/"><u>Troubleshooting Steps: How to Resolve Issues with a Non-Functional Thaumaturge App on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/ultra-30-action-cam-the-essential-review-of-the-virb-series-for-2024/"><u>Ultra 30 Action Cam The Essential Review of the VIRB Series for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
