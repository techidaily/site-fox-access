## Part 1\. What Is a Podcast Logo?

Before we get into how great podcast logos are made, let's look at the basics of a podcast logo. It's important not to get podcast logos mixed up with podcast artwork. Podcast artwork can warry for episodes or series and represents them individually.

Podcast logos usually stay the same and are a visual representation of all your work. Your podcast logo depicts your content to the viewer, illustrating what your channel is all about.

![serial killers podcast logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcasts-logos-1.jpg)

Above is an excellent example of a perfect podcast logo. Just looking at the picture sets the entire mood of the podcast. Users can easily comprehend the podcast's content from the logo, and interested users can get straight to listening.

### Where to use

You can think of your podcast logo as a representation of your brand. Your podcast logo will be visible on all your podcast covers. You can also use your logo on websites and when you market your products.

### When to use

You can use your logo on your profile pictures and author detail sections. It can also act as your thumbnail. You can also add your logo to video podcasts to spread your brand.

Now that we've learned about the best logo-creating platforms, let's go over some of the things you should consider to make the best possible logo for your podcast.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Think about where your logo will be used

The most crucial aspect of your logo is its image size and quality. Your logo will be used in various places, so you need to have a set of different sizes. Your logo will only be helpful if visible, so you must ensure that you use a high enough image quality.

### 2\. Don’t be afraid to use color

The logo's color will stir up emotions in your audience and help set the mood for your podcast. Using bright and vivid colors is the best way to capture your audience. It's vital to keep the shade constant; otherwise, you'll end up with mismatched colors.

### 3\. Avoid overused icons

Icons are a fundamental part of any logo but using bland overused icons will not let you stand out in front of other podcast creators. It's best to use unique icons that viewers are attracted to and intrigued by.

### 1\. Think about where your logo will be used

The most crucial aspect of your logo is its image size and quality. Your logo will be used in various places, so you need to have a set of different sizes. Your logo will only be helpful if visible, so you must ensure that you use a high enough image quality.

### 2\. Don’t be afraid to use color

The logo's color will stir up emotions in your audience and help set the mood for your podcast. Using bright and vivid colors is the best way to capture your audience. It's vital to keep the shade constant; otherwise, you'll end up with mismatched colors.

### 3\. Avoid overused icons

Icons are a fundamental part of any logo but using bland overused icons will not let you stand out in front of other podcast creators. It's best to use unique icons that viewers are attracted to and intrigued by.
