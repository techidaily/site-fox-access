 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Most cameras you can find on the market can be used to [make a stop motion video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). In fact, there are no digital cameras on the market that are created solely for this purpose, which means that you need to search for a camera that can make this otherwise slow process somewhat easier.

 Opting for the camera that lets you control the focus and all other settings is probably the best choice you can make because all images you take should look almost identical for the illusion of stop motion to work.

[DSLRs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), compact cameras or [webcams](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can all be used to create stop motion videos, but with so many different models out there, it may be difficult to choose the best one. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best cameras for stop motion photography for both amateur and professional photographers.

## The Best Cameras You Can Use to Shoot Stop Motion Videos in 2020

 Even though the story of a stop motion video is its most important ingredient, the results you will be able to achieve largely depend on the equipment you have. In addition to a camera, you should also consider getting a tripod, lights and other accessories that can make the process of shooting a stop motion video easier. Here are some of the best cameras you can use to shoot stop motion videos in 2020.

### Part 1: Best Webcams for Amateur Stop Motion Photography

 If you are looking for the least expensive options, then you should consider using a webcam to capture the footage you will be using to make a stop motion video. In addition, most webcams work with stop motion software seamlessly, so you won’t have any problems importing large amounts of photos.

#### 1\. [Logitech C922x Pro Stream Webcam](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam)

**Price:** $99.99

 Despite the fact that this Logitech’s model is designed for streaming in full HD, you can still use it for stop motion photography. This webcam has a 78-degree viewing angle which gives you a lot of options while composing your shots. The Logitech Capture feature enables you to adjust camera settings and choose how bright or dark your images are going to be, apply the chroma key effect or create up to six settings profiles you can use whenever you want.

 Logitech’s C922x Pro Stream Webcam ships with a tripod which enables you to keep it perfectly still while taking the photos you want to include in the stop motion video you’re making.

Even though Besteker 1536p model is commonly used to record Skype conversations, you can still pair it with a stop motion software and take photos with it. Adjusting the exposure, aperture or ISO values isn’t possible, which makes it a bit difficult to control how bright or dark your images are going to be. The fact that all you need to do in order to set the focus manually is spin the focus lens makes Besteker 1536p Full HD webcam perfectly suited for stop motion videos.

### Part 3: Five Best DSLR Cameras for Stop Motion Photography

 The ability to choose the lens or adjust the camera settings for each shot you take makes DSLR cameras the best choice for stop motion photography.

 When it was first released in 2014, Nikon D3300 was one of the most powerful cameras on the market that had a 24.2 MP CMOS DX-Format sensor. In the meantime, this Nikon’s model has been archived, so you can no longer purchase it from the manufacturer.

## Bonus tip: The Best Mirrorless Camera for Stop Motion Photography

 During the process of creating a stop motion video, you will have to take hundreds of shots, which will eventually take its toll on DSLR’s mechanical shutter. That is why cinematographers often use mirrorless cameras that have electronic shutters to capture the footage for their stop motion videos.

#### 1\. [Lumix S1H Digital Mirrorless Camera](https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/lumix-interchangeable-lens-ilc-cameras/DC-S1HBODY.html)

**Price:** $3.999.99

 A full-frame sensor, 6K 10-bit videos or dual native ISO are just a few reasons why film industry professionals love using Lumix S1H. The camera also has the Stop Motion Animation mode, but you must make sure that the Time-Lapse setting is enabled before you can use it. You can take each photo in the stop motion sequence yourself or set an interval in which the camera will take photos automatically. Once you’re done shooting the camera will generate the video for you, so that you can just transfer it to your computer and edit it. If you would like to make professional stop motion animations, then Lumix S1H is one of the best cameras you can choose.

**Pros**

* Electronic shutter
* Features a Stop Motion Animation mode
* Generates a stop motion video automatically
* Great lens compatibility

**Cons**

* Hefty price tag

## The Features You Need to Pay Attention to While Choosing a Camera for Stop Motion Photography

 Sadly, using any digital camera for stop motion photography just isn’t possible, because without certain features you are not going to be able to complete your project. That’s why you should choose a camera that offers the following options

### Manual Focus and Controls

 Being able to control the focus manually is vital for the success of your stop motion video project. The objects in the shot are moving constantly, which can make it difficult for camera’s autofocus to keep the focus where you want it to be. That’s why the camera you use for stop motion photography must offer the manual focus option.

 Moreover, controlling the ISO, aperture and exposure values by yourself is as important as pulling the focus manually, since even the slightest light change can cause a sea of continuity problems.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Remote Shutter Release

 The camera must be perfectly still throughout the entire process, and sometimes just placing the camera on a tripod is not going to be enough. That’s why you should opt for a camera that allows you to release the shutter remotely and avoid causing even the slightest vibration of a camera.

### Electronic Shutter

 Most mechanical shutters have an estimated lifetime of 100.000 shots, but a single stop motion video can easily have thousands of images. That’s why choosing a mirrorless camera that has an electronic shutter can be a good choice, since you won’t have to worry about the number of shots you take.

**Conclusion**

 Having the right equipment for stop motion photography is as important as the story you want to tell in your video. Luckily, cameras from all price ranges can be used to create stop motion animations, which means that you can create a stunning stop motion animation even with a webcam. Which camera for stop motion animation are you using? Leave a comment and let us know.
