## Part 2\. How to choose the best podcast microphone for you?

Getting confused is standard with multiple types and models available for podcast microphones. Though the essential function of all these devices is the same, several features differentiate between them and make each one suitable for a certain task or requirement. So, to help you buy the best one, the below checklist will be of great help.

**1\. XLR Vs. USB microphone**

The first important thing you would need to consider before making the purchase is how the microphone will be connected for the recording. The most commonly used mics are those with a USB and plug-and-play devices. These are simple to use and do not require any advanced and technical sound knowledge. Just plug these mics into your laptop and get the recording started. Since USB mics are pocket-friendly, they are generally the first choices when you start your podcasting journey.

On the other hand, the mics with XLR connectors are advanced devices that come with an audio interface or a podcast mixer. With these, multiple mics can be connected simultaneously and offer control over the sound levels. To use these microphones, extra equipment and knowledge about the audio and sounds are needed to make the best of them.

There are a few mics available that offer both USB as well as XLR connections.

**2\. Number of people using the mic at the same time**

Another important factor for mic determination is the number of people using the mic at a time. The Cardioid pick-up pattern devices are apt for situations when a single person has to speak on the mic directly. On the other hand, if two or more people are using the mic, you would need to choose the one capable of multiple-pickup patterns.

**3\. Included audio software**

Another deciding factor is the audio software. Depending on your requirements, choose a simple device without any included software or go for one with audio editing or music production software.

**4\. Budget**

Last but not least is the budget for your mic. You need to set a budget and then accordingly check which is the best mic that fits into your category.

## Part 3\. What else do you need to start podcasting?

Above, we have discussed the importance of a good podcasting mic and the available varieties and models. In addition, another important thing you would need to create an excellent podcast is a professional audio recording and editing tool. Good software helps customize, edit, and create a polished version of your podcast.

One such program that we recommend here is [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Though video editing software, it also offers excellent audio recording and editing features.

## Part 2\. How to choose the best podcast microphone for you?

Getting confused is standard with multiple types and models available for podcast microphones. Though the essential function of all these devices is the same, several features differentiate between them and make each one suitable for a certain task or requirement. So, to help you buy the best one, the below checklist will be of great help.

**1\. XLR Vs. USB microphone**

The first important thing you would need to consider before making the purchase is how the microphone will be connected for the recording. The most commonly used mics are those with a USB and plug-and-play devices. These are simple to use and do not require any advanced and technical sound knowledge. Just plug these mics into your laptop and get the recording started. Since USB mics are pocket-friendly, they are generally the first choices when you start your podcasting journey.

On the other hand, the mics with XLR connectors are advanced devices that come with an audio interface or a podcast mixer. With these, multiple mics can be connected simultaneously and offer control over the sound levels. To use these microphones, extra equipment and knowledge about the audio and sounds are needed to make the best of them.

There are a few mics available that offer both USB as well as XLR connections.

**2\. Number of people using the mic at the same time**

Another important factor for mic determination is the number of people using the mic at a time. The Cardioid pick-up pattern devices are apt for situations when a single person has to speak on the mic directly. On the other hand, if two or more people are using the mic, you would need to choose the one capable of multiple-pickup patterns.

**3\. Included audio software**

Another deciding factor is the audio software. Depending on your requirements, choose a simple device without any included software or go for one with audio editing or music production software.

**4\. Budget**

Last but not least is the budget for your mic. You need to set a budget and then accordingly check which is the best mic that fits into your category.
