 Many people prefer to buy cameras that have APS-C type image sensors; these sensors usually have a size that is almost half of the full frame size. But reviews reveal that it is also good to buy a bigger sensor that ensures brighter viewfinder along with larger focus. There is no doubt to say that market is loaded with lots of full frame models, the examples include Nikon D610 and Canon EOS 6D and you will be glad to know that cost of these cameras is now dropping day by day so you can have a better option for purchase even at low investment.

## How to choose the right 4K Full Frame Camera?

#### Section 1: What is Full-Frame?

 You might be interested to know about the term Full Frame as it is one of the biggest consideration for buying 4K cameras. Actually, the term Full Frame is a feature of digital sensors and it indicates that camera sensor is having size same as that of old 35mm film strip. In simple works, while buying a new 4K camera, you need not to make hard efforts to calculate the Full Frame rate abilities rather you simply need to check its focal length value and that will provide you information about Full Frame rating. When you have a full frame type DSLR then you can expect much higher file sizes for every shot because it ensures higher megapixel count for every collection.

#### Section 2: 4K Full Frame Camera Buying Advice

 While buying a new 4K camera you must check few specifications to ensure great results. Some of the essential considerations include size, weight, speed, still and video quality and cost of the lens. If we talk about most commonly used digital SLR cameras then they are often available with 30 ounce weight range whereas the specially designed action cameras such as Nikon D5 use to be heavier comparatively. Generally, professionals need to carry so many accessories for their shoots so their bags get too bulky; that is why they often search for light weight solutions.

 You might have heard that mirrorless lenses use to be light in weight but actually they are light up to certain limit only. Also, it is not necessary that a camera that has great video quality will offer great image response too; it may vary. For example, Sony Mirrorless A7S is well known for its high quality video responses but its quality decays for still that is limited only up to 12.2MP.

 Action shooters seek higher camera speeds so they often count on frames per second. But if you are beginner and want to use your camera for simple photography applications then you need not to worry about this factor. Other than this, you also need to focus upon lens quality but at the same time it will boost up your cost so pick the one with most satisfactory details as per your indented applications.
