The layout of this application is too user-friendly. It helps the new users to understand it very quickly and rapidly. Moreover, it provides users with the best viewing experience and fascinates them.

#### **Highly advanced features:**

You can use the highly advanced features in your videos using this application. However, they will be trending filters and effects, popular video templates and stickers, audio or video adjustments, etc., all can be avail using it. Although some are free and some need to be purchased.

### Disadvantages

Some of its disadvantages are the following:

#### **Export Quality:**

You can only export your video in SD quality using a free version. To export it in HD, FHD, and 4K resolution, you must purchase the premium version of it. Moreover, you cannot select the frame rate above 30 in the free version.

#### **Paid features:**

As we have described, not all this application's features are free. Some of them are premium which requires you to buy their premium version. Using its free version is a big drawback, as it develops mainly to make users buy its premium version.

#### **Watermark:**

The biggest con of using VideoShow is that they also put their watermark on the exported videos, which ruins the quality and look of your videos.
