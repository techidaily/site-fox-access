If you are using Zoom Meetings, you are lucky enough because you can add customized backgrounds to your video and work like a pro with Zoom.

### · Enhance Personal Space

For professional video conferences, you need to be more presentable and active. You don't have to do much to achieve what you want with Zoom Meetings. Turn on the 'Touch up Appearance.' Focus on the lighting where you are going to sit. Lastly, make sure you raise the computer to your eye level. This makes you look active and confident.
