 Enlarging a photo isn't such a difficult task- what is difficult is to maintain the quality of the resulting photo. This is one of the few issues which applications like Photoshop have been trying to deal with for years. Moreover if your job involves regular scaling up of images then you would surely do better with a specialized image enlargement software such as Photo Zoom by BenVista.

 Photo Zoom makes use of its unique technology developed by S- Spline XL to perform the task of image enlargement and image resizing. This simple and easy to use application which comes with a rather overstuffed interface would give the users plenty of tools for zooming in and changing the size of any given image. When you open your image with the help of this software you will be able to flip, rotate and crop the picture till you get the optimum size.

 The picture can be either directly dragged to the preview box or you can add the picture with the open button. On opening an image on PhotoZoom Pro you will be able to view all sorts of info about the image like its resolution, file size and if it is in the CYMK or RGB format.

#### Step 2: Setting a new size for the image

 The next thing you need to do is set the size of the resulting image. For this you need to set the resolution, height, width and aspect ratio for the picture. Now you need to select the new resolution and size of the picture and the software would automatically enlarge the picture for you. The navigation box on the top left of the application would allow the users to preview all the various parts of the image.

#### Step 3: Selecting the resize method for resizing the picture

 Now that you have set the desired height width and resolution of the picture, the next thing you need to do is choose a resize method for resizing the picture. The Photo Zoom Pro 7 app makes you of the S-Spline resize method by default. However the user is allowed to select from as many as 11 different resize methods such as S- Spline Max, Bicubic, Lanczos and many more. Each preset has a number of options with which you can tweak the resulting image.

 Apart from them you will also get a batch processing mode which allows you to resize the image folders. This app works great with iPhoto libraries as well. Out of all the available presets S-Spline Max is surely your best option since it gives you resized pictures which are good to look at.
