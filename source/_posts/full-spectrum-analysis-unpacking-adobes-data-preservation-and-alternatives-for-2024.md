### 4\. Do you need an internet connection to use Adobe Creative Cloud desktop app?

No. However, your computer must have the software to use the desktop apps in **Adobe Creative Cloud storage**, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Consequently, you can utilize them without a constant Internet connection.

The initial installation and licensing of your apps both require an Internet connection. Every 30 days, the desktop programs attempt to verify your software licenses.

### 5\. Can I put my Adobe application on a different computer?

You can install your **Adobe cloud storage** software on multiple computers and sign in (activate) on two of them but use it on only one device at a time with your license.

## Conclusion

In short, cloud storage is an online safe place to store and share files remotely. With **Adobe cloud storage,** one can easily achieve a good workflow between team members and remote workers. This exceptional **Adobe cloud storage pricing** is affordable and gives users access to 100GB of storage space with support for up to 20 creative apps. Besides, you can try out any of the alternatives listed, like Wondershare Drive, as a cheaper but the best alternative. So, test your creativity on creative apps with Adobe storage and others and ensure your content is safe.
