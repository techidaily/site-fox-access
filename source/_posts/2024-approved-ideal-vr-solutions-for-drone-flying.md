 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 2016 saw VR headsets become more commonplace, but by the end of 2016/beginning of 2017 VR technology was coupled with drones so that the videos captured could be viewed in realism never seen before. Just watching the films from Drones can make you feel as though you are part of the action, but actually having a 360 degree view as if you were flying yourself enhances the experience greatly. Drones with VR headsets give the user a totally immersive feel but not all are compatible. This means that you have to figure out which are suitable with the drones you are currently using. The first thing you need to figure out is whether you need a VR or FPR headset.

## VR vs FPV - Which Drone Headset Is Best for You?

| |  Pros                                                              | Cons                   |                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| FPV                                                                  | NO-LAG WITH HDMI cable | Short battery life         |
| |  Screen is cleaner                                                 | Size is a little large |                            |
| |  Change settings easily since it is separate from your phone or RC |                        |                            |
| VR                                                                   | Low price              | Screen quality is not good |
| |  Head track                                                        |                        |                            |

**Conclusion:**

 If you are going to need to dodge obstacles such as trees or even people/animals then the FPV is the best option because it has a low lag. VR is the best option if you want head tracking capabilities at a lower cost. If you are using a DJI product then a VR headset should be fine but any high speed filming and tracking will require FPV capabilities and is definitely worth the extra money to capture the best shots for an immersive experience.
