Then, launch the software and click **“Import”** to add two funny video songs to create a Keen funny ringtone.

Step2 Next, drag the files to the **“Timeline Panel.”** Now, right-click the video files and select **“Detach Audio”** to extract funny audio from videos, which will show on the audio track.
