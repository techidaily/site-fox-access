**Upload Your Photo and Banner-** A right image can make the right impression. It conveys your energy, urges to learn or work, your charisma, responsiveness, and various other soft skills that cannot be always expressed in words.

Follow the companies you target.

When you become confident and comfortable, you may start sharing your opinion on any company or industry article or photos, etc.
