3. Once you've found a suitable video, click on it to access its details page.
4. Find the "Download" button on the video's details page and click it to save the video to your computer's storage.

### Step 2: Motion Tracking in Filmora

To seamlessly embed your selected video within your digital picture frame, you'll need video editing software that supports motion tracking. Filmora, known for its user-friendly interface and robust features, can assist you in achieving this. Here's a more detailed guide on using Filmora for motion tracking:

### Step 3: Pin Your Video to Tracking Keyframes

To ensure that your video appears seamlessly integrated within the picture frame and follows its movement precisely, it's crucial to pin your video to tracking keyframes.

This process ensures that your video synchronizes with the frame's motion, creating a convincing illusion of a video playing within the frame:

1. Select your imported video on the timeline.
2. Navigate to the **"Effects"** tab in Filmora, followed by **"Utility,"** and choose **"Motion Tracking."**
3. Place the tracking box over the picture frame within your video.
4. Initiate the tracking process by clicking on the **"Track"**
5. Filmora will automatically track the picture frame's movement and generate keyframes for your video.

### Step 4: Adjust Details and Export

To fine-tune your Picture Frame Video and tailor it to your preferences, follow these steps:

1. Customize the size and position of your video within the frame to achieve a perfect fit.
2. Adjust your video's duration, speed, or orientation as needed to create the desired visual impact.
3. Optionally, incorporate additional effects or text overlays to enhance the video's appeal.

Once you've achieved the desired look for your Picture Frame Video, it's time to export your creation:

1. Click on the **"Export"** button within Filmora.
2. Select your preferred export settings, such as resolution and format.
3. Confirm your selections and initiate the export process by clicking **"Export."**
