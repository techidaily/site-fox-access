## Smooth Surfaces From Stability: Handheld Tech for Pros

When a YouTube video is shaky it’s hard to focus on what is happening in it. Camera shake is a huge distraction and, if it is a persistent problem in your YouTube videos, it will be hard to get subscribers. Shakiness is an easy problem to correct. With a bit of equipment, or a bit of creativity, it is easy to make sure your YouTube videos are nice and smooth.

## Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube

This article will talk about different types of equipment you can use to stabilize your camera. For vloggers on a budget, there is even one tip on stabilizing your camera without camera equipment. Here are some of the best stabilizers for YouTube videos:

### 1\. Tripod

A tripod is a three-legged stand you can mount your camera to. The height of a tripod can be adjusted so you can set your camera up at the level that works best for you. Because tripods can stand alone you can set your camera up to record yourself without needing a helper.

Tripods are the best choice for vlogs that revolve around you standing (or sitting) and delivering information, like opinion or beauty vlogs.

### 2\. Monopod

A monopod is like a tripod in the sense that you can adjust its height, but unlike a tripod a monopod has only one leg and cannot stand by itself. You will need a helper to stay with your camera if you plan to film yourself using a monopod. A monopod is more portable than a tripod, though, and can be used in a wider variety of places. You can even use a monopod to record aerial shots just by picking it up.

### 3\. Pistol Grip

A pistol grip is a handle you mount your camera to the top of. You can carry your camera around on top of the pistol grip, or you can mount the grip itself to your tripod or monopod. Once the grip is mounted you can use it to more easily control your camera movements. This is a great way to get even, steady, camera pans.

### 4\. Selfie Stick

A selfie stick is a long pole you mount your smartphone to one end of in order to take selfies from farther away. Selfie sticks also make great stabilizers if you are shooting video on your smartphone. To stabilize your smartphone place the handle of your selfie stick on the ground as if it were a monopod. When you are shooting using a selfie stick you can also hold it up in the air to get interesting high angle shots.

Some YouTubers even like to shoot selfie-style vlogs where the hold the selfie stick just like they are taking a photo of themselves.

### 5\. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization

‘Optical Image Stabilization’ is fairly new hardware which is built in to a lot of new smartphones, like the iPhone 6S Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. OIS reduces camera shake by a lot, although it is still a good idea to stabilize your smartphone while you record. OIS will also help you take sharper still photos without using any software.

### 6\. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect

If you do not have equipment, or cannot bring it where you want to shoot, then you can still record steady footage. You just have to get creative with where you put your camera. Any stable surface will do. You can set your camera down on a shelf in your house, a picnic bench, or up in a tree.

If you are able to lean your elbows onto a desk or table while you hold your camera then that will also significantly cut down on camera shake. This works best for footage you are not in, or which you can have a helper film for you. If you are open to shooting a selfie-style vlog then you can use anything you can rest your hand on, like a fence or a railing.
