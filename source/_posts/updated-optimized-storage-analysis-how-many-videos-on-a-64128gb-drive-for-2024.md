## Optimized Storage Analysis: How Many Videos on a 64/128GB Drive?

## How much video can 64GB hold?

Based on the normal video resolution of 4k at 60fps, a 64GB storage device can keep more than 1 hour and 20 minutes of video time.

A 64GB storage device can hold more than 1 hour and 37 minutes of video at a resolution of 2.7k at 120fps. On a 64GB memory card, recording at a resolution of 1080p at 60fps allows for around 5 hours of video time.

## How much video can 128GB hold?

A 128GB memory card may carry about 75 or 76 videos if each film is only 3 minutes long.

The data rate of movies is generally influenced by the format and codec of the videos. When this happens, the time it takes for a memory card of that capacity to fill up can be affected. A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of video at 1080p HD. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen.

A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of footage at 1080p at 4k resolution. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen. A standard 128GB memory card can hold up to 48 hours of film at 720p at 4k resolution. A data rate of roughly 4.42MB/s is also required.

Go to the Format tab and set the output to the original video format. Then, in the "Settings" panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by selecting a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. If the video format is not important to you, you can choose from various formats such as FLV, MP4, and others, which produce lower files.

### Step 3: Export the file

Now press the Export button to create a considerably smaller file. When it's finished, click "find target" to acquire the compressed file, which you can then freely share with your friends.

The strategy described above is simply one way to reduce the size of a video file during Export. You can also crop out the video frame or change the frame scale to lower the video size.

Compatibility: Online

If you don't want to install or use an app on your computer, many websites will allow you to submit a video file and compress it for you. Some of these services demand registration, others charge a monthly fee (or place a watermark on your movie), and others are free and only require a video file.

VEED.IO is the first service we'll look at. VEED provides a simple video compression tool for free as part of its video editing tools. It works on both Windows and Mac, and it runs entirely within your browser, so no software is required.

Open the web browser and open the veed.io video compressor. Import the video file by clicking on 'Upload a file.'
