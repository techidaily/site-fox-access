## Part 1\. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?

Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user's hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.

By tracking the user's hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.

The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2's one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.

With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.

## Part 2\. Types Of Hand Tracking

There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:

### Tracking With Interface

With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:

**1\. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves**

Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.

These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.

**2\. Optical Motion Capture Systems**

Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.

Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.

The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.

### Tracking Without Interface

Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.

Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.

## Part 3\. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking

Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.

Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.

### What is OpenCV

### What Is Media Pipe

Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.

There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:

1. **Palm Detection**: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.
2. **Hand Landmarks Identification**: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.

## Part 2\. Types Of Hand Tracking

There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:

### Tracking With Interface

With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:

**1\. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves**

Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.
