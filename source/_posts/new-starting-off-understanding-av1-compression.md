## Part1: What is the av01 codec?

Initially, companies relied on proprietary technology to provide you with video content. For example, most video providers were using variants of MPEG codecs to edit their online content, with others preferring  for 4K content. However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.

As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions. Through this collaboration, the Aomedia Video 1 (AV1) codec came to be. Here are some questions to help you understand the technology much better.

### What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?

A codec is a type of compression technology that consists of two parts:

* An encoder compresses the original file to smaller sizes that you can share through the internet or other portable storage.
* A decoder to decompress the file to its original format.

In addition, you can use different types of codecs depending on the file format. For example, MPEG codecs were the preferred choice for video files. However, streaming companies now use codec AV1 for their content. This is because it offers faster compression times and smaller files than other previous video codecs.

### 5\. VirtualDub

**Compatibility**: Windows.

**Price**: Free

**Supported video formats**: AV1, MPEG, and BMP.

VirtualDub is a free-to-use video editing software under the GNU General Public License. As such, you can distribute modified software versions without fear of legal action. Currently, it is only available to Windows users on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.

Some of the program's core features include:

* Fractional frame rating allows you precise editing. For example, you can adjust your video frame rate to within two decimal places of the absolute value.
* The program offers an integrated volume meter and histogram for input level monitoring.
* You also can enable keyboard and mouse shortcuts for faster editing.
* Furthermore, VirtualDub uses optimized disk access, ensuring consistent internal storage usage.

Unfortunately, the video editor operates an outdated user interface, which can be a turn-off for some creators. In addition, it offers limited support for file extensions, limiting its video editing capabilities.

### Can you play AV1 codec videos on YouTube?

No. YouTube applies extra compression to your videos regardless of the codec you use to edit your videos. As such, your videos may be unclear when uploading them to the platform. However, it applies the AV1 codec on videos with over 1 million likes as part of its codec testing.
