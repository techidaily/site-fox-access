## Part 1\. What Is Video Resolution

If we speak in basic words, video resolution means the number of pixels displayed in each distinct dimension. The resolution of any video is usually written as a combination of height and width. If you want to know how clear the video is or how realistic it looks, then video resolution is that one element that will answer all your questions. Sounds intriguing, right?

With video resolution, you can see video images in any video recording. When you hear someone say the high-resolution video, the viewer can see a sharp and clear video. A higher number of pixels results in high quality and better resolution video. Ultra HD and Full HD are the two widely used video resolutions. Don't know much about them? Nothing to worry!

Whereas, whenever you come across the word low-resolution video or poor resolution video, it means that there is a low number of pixels. Now moving on, let us talk a little about the two significant types of video resolution. One is the default type, that's the 'Spatial Resolution.' It is measured in pixels with the height and the width. In contrast, the other type is the 'Temporal Resolution,' which is the frames rate.

## Part 2\. Types of Video Resolution List

After discussing video resolution, now it's time to jump and discuss the list of video resolutions. There are various resolutions. The naming convention of these resolutions is based on how the pixels are running. It could either be a vertical line moving down the display area, or the movement could be across the frame in a horizontal line.

Want to know more about them? Without further delay, let us start sharing the video resolution list one by one. The order of types will be from low to high and Ultra HD.

![types of video resolutions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-video-resolution-for-beginners-2.jpg)

### · Standard Definition Resolution (SD)

360p and 480p are the most popular standard definition (SD) resolutions. As mentioned earlier, pixels are a combination of height and width, so 360p is 640 x 360 resolution, whereas 640 x 480 is 480p resolution. Since the advancement of television and monitors, no one films in SD resolutions anymore. The world is changing, for sure!

360p resolution is still the most suitable option for smartphones and other mobile devices. This is because it uses less data. Whereas DVDs are the best example of using 480p resolution size.

### · High Definition Resolution – 720p

The resolution world is divided among High Definition Resolution (HD) and Standard Definition Resolution (SD). 720p is the lowest video resolution and is generally referred to as HD. For smaller web content, 720p is an ideal video resolution. Now are days, most computer screens are already HD.

### · Full HD resolution – 1080p

The next type of video resolution that we will talk about is 1080p. This resolution is often known as Full HD resolution. 1080p resolution is now the standard for the industry to film HD digital videos. Full HD videos mostly have a resolution of 1920 x 1080.

With the advancement and change in time, many smartphones now have a screen resolution of 1080p. The video quality with 1080p resolution is better and clear. Sounds much better!

### · 2K Resolution

The next type of video resolution is 2K video resolution. It is generally known as QHD or Quad High Definition. This type of resolution is found on high-end smartphones and gaming monitors. With every next resolution we are discussing, the video quality is getting better and better. With these resolutions, reframing is done without any quality loss.

Another thing that you should know about 2K videos is because it has a resolution of 2048 x 1080\. A crazy thing about QHD is that some premium smartphones offer Quad HD+. Isn't it great?

### · 4K Resolution

As we mentioned earlier that the quality is improving with every next type of resolution, so now it's time to talk about the Ultra High Definition or the 4K video resolution. Although 2K and 4K are somewhat, similar experts say that with 4K, you have better editing options, and you can also zoom in.

4K resolution is used where you need intense color and graphics. 4K videos have a resolution of 3840 x 2160\. This really is something!

### · 8K Resolution

The last video resolution type that we will highlight is 8K video resolution. This is also referred to as Full Ultra High Definition. This is the best option for zooming in to take a distant shot. 8k is the video super-resolution.

Although filmmakers don't usually film with this video resolution, if they do, then one thing that they achieve is enhanced visual effects. Also, with using 8K video resolution, you can easily reframe without the fear of losing quality. It has a video resolution of 7680 x 4320\. This is the future!
