 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

If you created a funny video with your friends or caught a wonderful scene in nature, you may want to send the video to someone. Or maybe you want to upload it online. The problem is that some videos have a very large file size, which makes uploading or sending it to someone difficult. That is why you may need to **compress the video on Android** before you can send it out.

The good news is that you can easily use free applications on your Android phone to compress those videos. Then you can delete the original video, free up space on your phone, and send the video out to anyone you want! Here are six apps for compressing video on Android.

## Top Six Free Android Apps for Compressing Video

#### 1. [Video Compress](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melgames.videocompress&hl=en)

Video compress makes it much easier to compress videos and share them on social networks, such as Facebook, Google+, WhatsApp, and more.

* The feature of sending video to the user through SMS does not always work.

#### 2. [Resize Video](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeedifice.resizevideo&hl=en)

With Resize Video, you can easily compress video on Android phones and tablets. You can pick the video size that is to your liking, and you can even trim the video’s length before compression.

![resize video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resize-video.JPG)

#### 3. [Video Compressor by Sunshine](https://apkpure.com/video-compressor-by-sunshine/com.sunshineapp.compression.sunshinecompression)

Video Compressor by Sunshine is one of the few multi-video compressors available on the Play Store. You can turn multiple videos into one compressed file to save space on your phone.

![video compressor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-compressor-Sunshine.JPG)

**Pros:**

* Compresses many large files into one smaller file, if desired.

* Transfer your compressed videos instantly.

**Cons:**

* Only compresses files you create on your phone, not ones downloaded from various online sources.

#### 4. [Videos & Movies Compressor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sociosoft.videocompress)

Videos & Movies Compressor offers support for all popular video formats. The application makes it easy to compress video on Android and share it with friends or family.

#### 5. [Video Dieter 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outplaylab.VideoDiet2)

With Video Dieter, it is very simple to decide how much to compress your video. Remember that each reduction in file size reduces quality, so you will want to find the right balance. The software also makes sharing videos very easy.
