Follow these steps to use the **green screen in KineMaster** to take your video editing to the next level:

Step1 Head to [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree&hl=en&gl=US) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster-video-editor/id1609369954) and install **KineMaster** on your device.
