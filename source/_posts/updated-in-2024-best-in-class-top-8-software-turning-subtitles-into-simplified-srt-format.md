### 3\. Compatible formats

Check if the application is compatible with SUB subtitle and SRT extensions or not. Besides, check if the app supports the desirable format if you want to convert the SRT file to another format.

### 4\. Stability

## Final words

In addition, if you want to access full edit and conversion features, check the pricing plans and ensure they are within your affordable range.
