![few options after selecting the movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-video-speed-controller-extensions-14.jpg)

* **Customize**: Five-speed points, by default, let you set the speed precisely how you like.
* **Hero Moment**: There are eight-speed intervals in the video's playback rate, representing a regular, fast, slow, fast, and standard rhythm: 1.0x, 1.0x, 5.4x, 0.5x, 0.5x, 5.4x, 1.0x, and 1.0x.
* **Montage**: The various (six) speed levels in the video's playback speed—0.9x, 0.9x, 6.9x, 0.3x, and 1.0x—present a slow, slow, fast, slow, and regular pace.
* **Bullet Time**: There are six different speed levels in the video's playback speed, representing a fast, fast, slow, fast, fast rhythm: 5.2x, 5.2x, 0.5x, 5.2x, and 5.2x.
